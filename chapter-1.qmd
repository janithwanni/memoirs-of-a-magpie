# On the value of one's life

Strangely enough, I have met quite a lot of people that seem to value the people around them than themselves. They would go above and beyond to help their inner circles stay motivated and consistent, yet rarely will they be able to do the same for themselves. There are those who do not follow the pattern and the proportions of those who do are not part of this stream of thought. My focus is on those who value those around them more than themselves. The selfless martyrs that are willing to cross oceans regardless of whether they are willing to jump through puddles. Being such a person myself, I had to ask myself. Why did I come to this stage? What sort of behavior in my childhood attributed me to being a person that was willing to help others no matter what? Perhaps it could have been religious influence or the way that I observed my parents to be acting when others were under duress. Or it could be that I was primed to understand that only those who gave everything they had and asked for none were truly valued by everyone else. Regardless of the reason we are here now.

The twisted side to this thought patterns comes when you are in a long term friendship  / relationship.
