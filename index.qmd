This is my ikigai (生き甲斐) [^1]. My purpose in life when I searched through my soul was to leave a legacy behind to be remembered by. Out of the few things that I'm good at, writing and overthinking are one of them. In the chapters to come I will be putting onto tiny little pixels on your screen a stream of consciousness. My consciousness to be precise. This is my way of leaving behind a legacy wherein someone will stumble through these pages and find some use of it. Or if not someone might see this last attempt at finding purpose in life and see the importance of it. If all of the above fails then at least someone will look at these pages and see that what matters is not the blank half written pages that see the light of day, but the ideas that yearn to be seen and heard. I will be putting forth different aspects of my life and the things that I have learnt from them.

Very minimal amount of editing will be done in these chapters and therefore long running sentences and minor typos are bound to be present.

With that being said travel along these chapters until you find any that catches your eye. The chapters aren't linked with each other. Each chapter will be a new stream of thoughts and similar streams of thoughts would probably be grouped together.

But I hear you ask, why is this in a book format? This could have been a blog. Yes, it could have been many things. A blog, an essay or just a social media post. The reason for that is simple, I wanted to write a book ever since I was little. Now when considering my time, skill and energy upto now, I might not be able to make a good contribution of a book. Therefore this is the book that I shall leave behind at my demise. Just the thoughts that made up who I am, not the long winding biographical details and storylines, but rather my mind as ever changing it is. 

In no means are my thoughts and ideas the gospel truth or the absolutely correct pattern of thinking. It is of human nature to view the same world in different perspectives. That is what brings growth. Therefore in these pages I will be bearing my true self in it's raw form. I will be bearing out the flaws that my thinking and how I came one step closer to thinking in a different and hopefully better way of thinking.
