    "text": "Welcome\nThis is my ikigai (生き甲斐) 1. My purpose in life when I searched through my soul was to leave a legacy behind to be remembered by. Out of the few things that I’m good at, writing and overthinking are one of them. In the chapters to come I will be putting onto tiny little pixels on your screen a stream of consciousness. My consciousness to be precise. This is my way of leaving behind a legacy wherein someone will stumble through these pages and find some use of it. Or if not someone might see this last attempt at finding purpose in life and see the importance of it. If all of the above fails then at least someone will look at these pages and see that what matters is not the blank half written pages that see the light of day, but the ideas that yearn to be seen and heard. I will be putting forth different aspects of my life and the things that I have learnt from them.\nBut I hear you ask, why is this in a book format? This could have been a blog. Yes, it could have been many things. A blog, an essay or just a social media post. The reason for that is simple, I wanted to write a book ever since I was little. Now when considering my time, skill and energy upto now, I might not be able to make a good contribution of a book. Therefore this is the book that I shall leave behind at my demise. Just the thoughts that made up who I am, not the long winding biographical details and storylines, but rather my mind as ever changing it is.\nIn no means are my thoughts and ideas the gospel truth or the absolutely correct pattern of thinking. It is of human nature to view the same world in different perspectives. That is what brings growth. Therefore in these pages I will be bearing my true self in it’s raw form. I will be bearing out the flaws that my thinking and how I came one step closer to thinking in a different and hopefully better way of thinking."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Strangely enough, I have met quite a lot of people that seem to value the people around them than themselves. They would go above and beyond to help their inner circles stay motivated and consistent, yet rarely will they be able to do the same for themselves. There are those who do not follow the pattern and the proportions of those who do and don’t are not part of this stream of thought. My focus is on those who value the people around them more than themselves. The selfless martyrs that are willing to cross oceans regardless of whether other party is willing to jump through puddles.\nBeing such a person myself, I had to ask myself. Why did I come to this stage? What sort of behavior in my childhood attributed me to being a person that was willing to help others no matter what? Perhaps it could have been religious influence or the way that I observed my parents to be acting when others were under duress. Or it could be that I was primed to understand that only those who gave everything they had and asked for none were truly valued by everyone else. Regardless of the reason we are here now. They say knowing is half the battle and I do not believe knowing the reason why would give us much solace in most cases. But understanding what this issue means to our lives and how we can navigate into the future from where we are matters more in my opinion.\nWhile the world does need more of people who are selfless and kind, continued exposure to these behaviors may cause people to erupt and go into extremes of either being completely negelctful of everyone around them or damage themselves in a way that their help can not be well received. I have been through this question quite a lot. It might be my ADHD speaking but I would sometimes go into hyperfocus mode when it comes to the people around me to the point that it becomes unhealthy for both parties as the receiving end develops a learned helplessness while the other end fights a constant battle between what their soul is telling them vs what their hearts and minds are telling them.\nIt is human nature to perservere. Ask anyone who has attempted to end their life (it would be quite difficult to ask someone who succeeded) how much the human body desires to live. Try holding your breath to see how quickly you gasp for air, glad to be alive again. Try tieing a polythene bag over your head and slowly notice how your fingers automatically claw at the knot to find air to breathe. Watch how many people who were caught in between their self burn attempts would desparately try to douse themselves of the fire. Many people have chosen these examples to showcase that those who try to commit suicide actually are not genuinely trying to do it. The reason why I brought this up was because inside every person that overworks themselves to please or satisfy someone else is a battle between the heart and the soul. The heart feels emotions and wants to help the person in distress selflessly, while the soul is struggling to make room and adjust the stress levels for recovery and perservearance. Like a pendulum swinging back and forth the mind of the martyr swings between “I will do anything to help you through this.” and “I hate this, can’t you honestly do this by yourself?”. This toxic behavior builds up to the point of bringing in another problem which I will discuss in length below.\nAn interesting aspect of my thought pattern that I have come to realize after years of battling depression, is that I would put value to my life based on how much I’m capable of helping those around me. The process is pretty straightforward. First I try to selflessly help many people around me by taking up too many tasks and opportunities, which brings me to a state of being unable to work well in across all of these tasks. Any person with an ounce of sense would be screaming out that you can’t have all of the tasks and still be good at all of them. That is something I have to learn slowly and as I put down my thoughts. Hopefully putting down my thought process on a book for the world to see will either help me change the way that I think or the world will give me signs that I need to change the way that I’m thinking. Anyways, once I have filled my plate, I will take this challenge head on with all of the intensity that I can muster as there is always something novel to explore. However, as I’m giving inadaquate amounts of efforts in each section my progress dims down significantly. It comes to the point where I would be feeling like I’m actually putting no value into these projects. The usual existential crisis of “What am I even doing with these things?” comes into play at full swing at this moment. As I step down into this magical land slowly the things that I have done so far start to crumble infront of me. Whatever work I have created or any good I have done in this world is reduced to pure coincidence and just luck. I might have helped someone through their toughest times but at that moment it would simply be disregarded as “just telling obvious things that anyone would have said”, “I just happened to be there and anyone else could have done the same thing”. It’s fascinating how this happens though. It could be rooted in my childhood where I observed the pattern that once I fail to do one task, I was considered a failure regardless of the other tasks that I have done. As I have said earlier, this is not an inspection into why but rather a what can be done. Now once my mind has brought all of my work and everything I have done to zero value by categorizing the work as something that anyone could have done, it will come to a fun conclusion.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I put value on my life based on how much I’m capable of helping people. Now when the value of those helping moments are dimnished I have to come to the conclusion that my life itself has no value. What use is a life that is not useful to others. But that is only a perspective that I hold on to my life and only to it. I will not be thinking the same way of the people that I’m with. In fact I would thank them many times just for being there and that what they have done is quite unique and irreplacable.\nWhat exactly gives value to a life? Is it truly the work that they have done for the people around them, or is it based on the energy that they bring to the people around them? These are questions that would need to be discussed in length in the upcoming pages, but for now let’s explore the different ways that people value their lives. When given the question, what makes your life valuable? It raises a secondary underlying question? Why should a life be valued? The notion of a hierarchy is what brings forth a majority of inequalities and suffering. Instead of asking what makes your life valuable the real question would be to ask, what is your reason for living? If you are living simply because of someone else that is when you start giving a value to your life based on the usefulness that you have towrds others. But instead if you are living for your own self, then the value of your life only depends on the things that your heart yearns to do. And the heart can yearn for a lot of things. At our lowest moment, our heart yearns to feel connected. From what I have experienced, there is always an opportunity for a person to feel connected. Feeling connected does not necessarily mean that you need to be talking with people, although in my case that is how I connect with people. If that is the way you connect with people then you might want to stay tuned because even I’m at a loss when it comes to that stage. My initial hypothesis was that talking with people on the internet or even in a bar might be helpful. But it requires energy to get out of your low stage and walk or travel to the nearest place where people gather. That is why my next hypothesis was that it might be a good idea to simply go and join any random twitch stream and comment along with other people. You might feel a certain kindredship in the way that everyone is rooting for the same person to play the game in a certain way.\nThe games that people play are certainly interesting. You can meet a bunch of people that are playing a game of pool and you can simply be in the sidelines cheering along with the rest of the crowd and as they see your enthusiasm and your cheers, they slowly open up to you. It’s an interesting phenomenon that I have experienced in countries that are outside of the south asian region. It depends on the openness of the group that is playing to accept people from the outside. Generally if people are going in a tight knit group with only the idea of enjoying the moment with that group alone."

    "text": "Humans are interesting in the way that they play different games with the people around them. Most of these games are seen in large screens and stadiums alike. But the games that go unseen a lot are the games of social interactions. Every human as they grow up builds up different standards, governing rules or presets for the social interactions that they experience. They build certain rules within them and as they grow old and meet other people who uphold similar standards these rules start solidifying gradually. Some might call these biases or some might even call these common sense.\nI have been told many times that I am someone who seems to struggle to understand these social cues. I have lost many friendships due to that. Lost is a pretty dramatic word I believe and therefore a better phrase would be broken beyond recognition (I’m sure there’s a German word for that phrase). This book is mainly about what I have learned and experienced in my lifetime. Anyone else who is going through a similar problem could take a look at this book and understand my thought process or in the untimely case that someone is reading this after I have passed away they would understand the"

In my case, I believe it’s best I keep a list of reasons why I wanted to write this book. They might not exactly be bullet lists. As you might have noticed, my thinking pattern is more towards the long form of writing and not exactly towards short concise and precise articulated points.\nOne reason that I can see is that there are people who might have gone through a set of experiences similar to mine or might have observed someone going through something similar. Perhaps this book will give them insight on their thought patterns. I haven’t really identified a reader audience and tailored this book towards a specific audience. But on the off chance someone stumbles on this book and finds it interesting I hope it helps them get a new perspective on life.\nAnother reason is that I believe that my way of thinking is a bit different to others. How modest of me, to think that I’m unique to others. Well in reality I am. Each person who reads this book has a completely new perspective in life. In a world of unique people, does being unique become normal? I hope not. Normalcy requires that everyone follows the same predictable pattern, but if everyone is different and unique in the way of their thinking, then I believe being unique still holds value. An interesting argument that I have read from a book on Zen Buddhism was that every person in this world are unique while also being part of oneness (I’m not sure what the exact label to put, Daoism calls it the Dao and you might call it Mother Nature). That’s just a side tangent that I wanted to put in there.\nRegardless, if my thinking pattern is unique and not the same as everyone else, then I believe there is something for others to read and understand from my perspective hopefully. Even if it is to read this and understand that “This is not the way a person should be thinking”. That is still progress. Everyone’s working hard to write books on how to do things right. No one tries to write a book on One of the thousand ways of doing things wrong.\nFinally, the reason I write this book is to leave behind my thoughts for others in the case of untimely death be it self inflicted or natural or tragic. As the first quote goes, I do not want to give up without putting down everything that I have thought of and felt in this life."
