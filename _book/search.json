    "text": "Preface\nThis is my ikigai (生き甲斐) 1. My purpose in life when I searched through my soul was to leave a legacy behind to be remembered by. Out of the few things that I’m good at, writing and overthinking are one of them. In the chapters to come I will be putting onto tiny little pixels on your screen a stream of consciousness. My consciousness to be precise. This is my way of leaving behind a legacy wherein someone will stumble through these pages and find some use of it. Or if not someone might see this last attempt at finding purpose in life and see the importance of it. If all of the above fails then at least someone will look at these pages and see that what matters is not the blank half written pages that see the light of day, but the ideas that yearn to be seen and heard. I will be putting forth different aspects of my life and the things that I have learnt from them.\nBut I hear you ask, why is this in a book format? This could have been a blog. Yes, it could have been many things. A blog, an essay or just a social media post. The reason for that is simple, I wanted to write a book ever since I was little. Now when considering my time, skill and energy upto now. I might not be able to make a good contribution of a book. Therefore this is the book that I shall leave behind at my demise. Just the thoughts that made up who I am, not the long winding biographical details and storylines, but rather my mind as ever changing it is.\nIn no means are my thoughts and ideas the gospel truth or the absolutely correct pattern of thinking. It is of human nature to view the same world in different perspectives. That is what brings growth. Therefore in these pages I will be bearing my true self in it’s raw form. I will be bearing out the flaws that my thinking and how I came one step closer to thinking in a different and hopefully better way of thinking."

    "text": "Strangely enough, I have met quite a lot of people that seem to value the people around them than themselves. They would go above and beyond to help their inner circles stay motivated and consistent, yet rarely will they be able to do the same for themselves. There are those who do not follow the pattern and the proportions of those who do are not part of this stream of thought. My focus is on those who value those around them more than themselves. The selfless martyrs that are willing to cross oceans regardless of whether they are willing to jump through puddles.\nBeing such a person myself, I had to ask myself. Why did I come to this stage? What sort of behavior in my childhood attributed me to being a person that was willing to help others no matter what? Perhaps it could have been religious influence or the way that I observed my parents to be acting when others were under duress. Or it could be that I was primed to understand that only those who gave everything they had and asked for none were truly valued by everyone else. Regardless of the reason we are here now. They say knowing is half the battle and I do not believe knowing the reason why would give us much solace. But understanding what this issue means to our lives and how we can navigate into the future from where we are matters more in my opinion.\nWhile the world does need more of people who are selfless and kind, continued exposure to these behaviors may cause people to erupt and go into extremes of either being completely negelctful of everyone around them or damage themselves in a way that their help can not be well received. I have been through this question quite a lot? It might be my ADHD speaking when I have hyperfocus when it comes to the people around me to the point that it becomes unhealthy for both parties as the receiving end develops a learned helplessness while the other end fights a constant battle between what their soul is telling them vs what their hearts and minds are telling them. It is human nature to perservere. Ask anyone who has attempted to end their life (it would be quite difficult to ask someone who succeeded) how much the human body desires to live. Try holding your breath to see how quickly you gasp for air, glad to be alive again. Try tieing a polythene bag over your head and slowly notice how your fingers automatically claw at the knot to find air to breathe. Watch how many person who was caught in between their self burn attempts would desparately try to douse themselves of the fire. Many people have chosen these examples to showcase that those who try to commit suicide actually are not genuinely trying to do it. The reason why I brought this up was because inside every person that overworks themselves to please or satisfy someone else is a battle between the heart and the soul. The heart feels emotions and wants to help the person in distress selflessly, while the soul is struggling to make room and adjust the stress levels for recovery for perservearance. Like a pendulum swinging back and forth the mind of the martyr swings between “I will do anything to help you through this.” and “I effing hate this, can’t you honestly do this by yourself?”.\nAn interesting aspect of my thought pattern that I have come to realize after years of battling depression, is that I would value to my life based on how much I’m capable of helping those around me."
