    "text": "1 Welcome\nThis is my ikigai (生き甲斐) 1. My purpose in life when I searched through my soul was to leave a legacy behind to be remembered by. Out of the few things that I’m good at, writing and overthinking are one of them. In the chapters to come I will be putting onto tiny little pixels on your screen a stream of consciousness. My consciousness to be precise. This is my way of leaving behind a legacy wherein someone will stumble through these pages and find some use of it. Or if not someone might see this last attempt at finding purpose in life and see the importance of it. If all of the above fails then at least someone will look at these pages and see that what matters is not the blank half written pages that see the light of day, but the ideas that yearn to be seen and heard. I will be putting forth different aspects of my life and the things that I have learnt from them.\nBut I hear you ask, why is this in a book format? This could have been a blog. Yes, it could have been many things. A blog, an essay or just a social media post. The reason for that is simple, I wanted to write a book ever since I was little. Now when considering my time, skill and energy upto now, I might not be able to make a good contribution of a book. Therefore this is the book that I shall leave behind at my demise. Just the thoughts that made up who I am, not the long winding biographical details and storylines, but rather my mind as ever changing it is.\nIn no means are my thoughts and ideas the gospel truth or the absolutely correct pattern of thinking. It is of human nature to view the same world in different perspectives. That is what brings growth. Therefore in these pages I will be bearing my true self in it’s raw form. I will be bearing out the flaws that my thinking and how I came one step closer to thinking in a different and hopefully better way of thinking.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Almost everyone in their life has helped another person at some point or the other. Either by obligation or by kindness. What I will be talking about in this chapter is about the ways that people help each other, the morality of helping others, how people burn out from helping others and finally the expectations of receiving help.\nKindness is an obvious reason to help others. However, the real question is why are we being kind to this person. For many they feel a sense of sadness, empathy for the other person and thereby a desire to help comes into mind. There are other reasons that people help others. One would be to feel a sense of power or the other person. In this case people would feel that sense of sadness because they believe they are far ahead or in a better position in life. There is a slight tendency of some people in this category to impose their idea or help simply because they are better at it. In such cases it is best to avoid the help of such people although it might come at a price of actually being helpless. I personally prefer to preserve my autonomy than to give it away and follow someone else’s ideas blindly. That sounds a lot like I’m stubborn and whether you view it as a good or bad quality depends on the perspective you have on the quality. A stubborn detective chasing down a crime scene and not taking other’s opinions is accoladed when he turns out to be right while the stubborn man who sticks to his conservative ideas deeply is shunned. The same quality can be beneficial and harmful in certain scenarios.\nPeople tend to have a certain repulsion to help others who are way ahead of them in life and seem to be extremely resourceful. I have that tendency and I shroud it under the name of being efficient in who I am helping. The analogy being that there is no point to filling an cup that is already filled to the brim and is overflowing. One might argue that the person who already has a lot of help might not be receiving the right type of help and that I might be the person who can actually give the exact help they need. I must admit that is rare, partly because what I have to offer is in no way unique or extravagant. Therefore if I feel like this person will find a replacement help in case I am unavailable I would put less effort on to it. In a way, that is the way that I try to feel valued in life, where I feel important and responsible.\nThis feeling of being valued for your help comes from my childhood from what I have discovered through my therapy sessions. Growing up my parents always taught me to help others in need and it was accepted in the family that you are only useful in the household if you provide some help. Which is true in a way because maintaining a household is a collective effort. However, the slippery extreme of this becomes where you would not be able to exist in a place where your help is not needed, and my dear reader, we often will find ourselves in such places. In such cases, accepting that your value in life is not defined by the amount of help you do to others is crucial. I will add more on this on the chapter about the value of life (See Chapter 4). The gist of the idea is that the value of a person’s life is not measured by the help they give at a certain point in time but by the energy, personality and effect they have on other people. You might be in a completely new country unable to help anyone at all and you will spiral thinking you are not useful, believe me for I have been there. The reality is that there are things that you give to others by default unseen which includes the overall energy, compassion and empathy you bring to the table.\nAnother side effect of this extreme is that you would be unwilling to accept help unless you have shown that you can bring something to the table. This becomes increasingly frustrating to people who want to help you out when you are starting off new or if they have walked the path that you have walked in. I had to deal with many people like that and this aversion to accepting help has to come with time as they slowly learn to accept that getting help without any expectations is not wrong. My main argument I bring in such scenarios is that by not allowing others to help you, you are also depriving them of the opportunity to help you making them feel sad, frustrated and worried as they see that your current situation can be improved with what they have.I have tried to push myself away from that idea, into a state where I accept people’s help even if I can’t help them at the moment or maybe ever in the future. However, this also can be seen in a different perspective of me being selfish. The fine line between these two states are defined by the moment I refuse to help when asked for help, until then I can not proved to be selfish. However, be weary when accepting help from others, for sometimes people who want to give help might have an ulterior motive.\nRegarding those who do not want to accept help from others, there is also the case that they might already have people to help and your help might not exactly be needed. When giving help some people might not want to accept help because they have already established support networks. This is a hard pill to swallow but in most cases if you are a newcomer to an already established ecosystem it might be hard for you to find your place in this network where and who you can offer your help to. What I have learned is that I will offer my help and leave the door open for others to seek help while in the meantime I try to help myself by working on myself to be more useful, and also by accepting help from others to build trust and connections. There will always be a niche or something that you bring to the table and there will be someone who wants exactly that or something similar. Have faith in yourself and work on strategizing what you believe you can give best, is it quality or quantity or consistency or spontaneity?\nWhile helping people, there is a slight chance of us feeling burnt out from helping a lot of people. This feeling of burning out can represent itself in many ways. For me, this feeling of being burnt out came in the way of being overly irritated by minor inconviniences caused by mistakes from other people. For others burn out from helping too much can come in different ways such as developing a nihilistic perspective on life, isolating from everyone, having high expectations from people etc. Whatever the cause is, it is best to understand that part of helping people comes with a set of boundaries that you have to enforce on yourself internally and when necessary externally. For those who are not so used to saying no, the word boundaries does not go hand in hand when helping people most of the times. Let’s look at boundaries in a different way then. When people are expecting help from you, any sane person who is not a self centered tyrant would want to get help from you in a way that is sustainable to get help from you in the long run.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Humans are interesting in the way that they play different games with the people around them. Most of these games are seen in large screens and stadiums alike. But the games that go unseen a lot are the games of social interactions. Every human as they grow up builds up different standards, governing rules or presets for the social interactions that they experience. They build certain rules within them and as they grow old and meet other people who uphold similar standards these rules start solidifying gradually. Some might call these biases or some might even call these common sense.\nI have been told many times that I am someone who seems to struggle to understand these social cues. I have lost many friendships due to that. Lost is a pretty dramatic word I believe and therefore a better phrase would be broken beyond recognition (I’m sure there’s a German word for that phrase). I would often not see or understand these social cues and overstep boundaries or say things that offend or hurt people. The fault is primarily in me, one might say, and yes, that might predominantly be the case. But reliance on social cues and common sense to work your way through social interactions can be quite harmful actually.\nPicture this, you are a professional in the field of Computer science, to the point that you are the designated IT guy wherever you go. When dealing with people with less IT knowledge, you are bound to understand that the things that you hold as common sense might not be the same for the other people.\nNow let’s look at a person called Jane. Jane has lived her life learning how to talk with people by observing her parents and accepting the rules and advices that her parents gave strictly. As Jane grows up she finds like minded people that are also capable of speaking with her nonverbally the same way that she was brought up. She understands that following the inherited rules seems to work properly and she keeps on adding more rules as she grows up. Then Jane gets to meet John who has interacted with a different group of people, and John’s circle of friends are quite direct in the way they communicate, they do not leave anything for nonverbal communication and are always explicit about what they are feeling. When Jane has a conversation with John, she gets annoyed that John isn’t picking up on the nonverbal communication she’s having with John and calls him someone without social skills or common sense.\nWhile non verbal communication and explicit open communication has it’s place, I would advocate for the latter. Be explicit and precise in your speech by putting forth any discomfort or happiness that you felt and being specific about what you experienced and what you don’t want the other person to feel. Yes it’s a lot of work, and so is explaining in detail to your mother the features of her phone, but it pays off in the end.\nIf ever you feel that you aren’t getting non verbal communications, be direct about it and say upfront to a person, “Hey if you do ever feel uncomfortable or feel any distress from what I say while talking with you, please do tell me at that exact moment, you can directly say it without an issue. I’m asking this favor from you because I don’t want to cross your boundaries and make you feel even more uncomfortable.” Be upfront about these things. For an extroverted free thinker it’s really hard to do this because they are used to speaking their mind openly and explicitl.",

    "text": "Strangely enough, I have met quite a lot of people that seem to value the people around them than themselves. They would go above and beyond to help their inner circles stay motivated and consistent, yet rarely will they be able to do the same for themselves. There are those who do not follow the pattern and the proportions of those who do and don’t are not part of this stream of thought. My focus is on those who value the people around them more than themselves. The selfless martyrs that are willing to cross oceans regardless of whether other party is willing to jump through puddles.\nBeing such a person myself, I had to ask myself. Why did I come to this stage? What sort of behavior in my childhood attributed me to being a person that was willing to help others no matter what? Perhaps it could have been religious influence or the way that I observed my parents to be acting when others were under duress. Or it could be that I was primed to understand that only those who gave everything they had and asked for none were truly valued by everyone else. Regardless of the reason we are here now. They say knowing is half the battle and I do not believe knowing the reason why would give us much solace in most cases. But understanding what this issue means to our lives and how we can navigate into the future from where we are matters more in my opinion.\nWhile the world does need more of people who are selfless and kind, continued exposure to these behaviors may cause people to erupt and go into extremes of either being completely negelctful of everyone around them or damage themselves in a way that their help can not be well received. I have been through this question quite a lot. It might be my ADHD speaking but I would sometimes go into hyperfocus mode when it comes to the people around me to the point that it becomes unhealthy for both parties as the receiving end develops a learned helplessness while the other end fights a constant battle between what their soul is telling them vs what their hearts and minds are telling them.\nIt is human nature to perservere. Ask anyone who has attempted to end their life (it would be quite difficult to ask someone who succeeded) how much the human body desires to live. Try holding your breath to see how quickly you gasp for air, glad to be alive again. Try tieing a polythene bag over your head and slowly notice how your fingers automatically claw at the knot to find air to breathe. Watch how many people who were caught in between their self burn attempts would desparately try to douse themselves of the fire. Many people have chosen these examples to showcase that those who try to commit suicide actually are not genuinely trying to do it. The reason why I brought this up was because inside every person that overworks themselves to please or satisfy someone else is a battle between the heart and the soul. The heart feels emotions and wants to help the person in distress selflessly, while the soul is struggling to make room and adjust the stress levels for recovery and perservearance. Like a pendulum swinging back and forth the mind of the martyr swings between “I will do anything to help you through this.” and “I hate this, can’t you honestly do this by yourself?”. This toxic behavior builds up to the point of bringing in another problem which I will discuss in length below.\nAn interesting aspect of my thought pattern that I have come to realize after years of battling depression, is that I would put value to my life based on how much I’m capable of helping those around me. The process is pretty straightforward. First I try to selflessly help many people around me by taking up too many tasks and opportunities, which brings me to a state of being unable to work well in across all of these tasks. Any person with an ounce of sense would be screaming out that you can’t have all of the tasks and still be good at all of them. That is something I have to learn slowly and as I put down my thoughts. Hopefully putting down my thought process on a book for the world to see will either help me change the way that I think or the world will give me signs that I need to change the way that I’m thinking. Anyways, once I have filled my plate, I will take this challenge head on with all of the intensity that I can muster as there is always something novel to explore. However, as I’m giving inadaquate amounts of efforts in each section my progress dims down significantly. It comes to the point where I would be feeling like I’m actually putting no value into these projects. The usual existential crisis of “What am I even doing with these things?” comes into play at full swing at this moment. As I step down into this magical land slowly the things that I have done so far start to crumble infront of me. Whatever work I have created or any good I have done in this world is reduced to pure coincidence and just luck. I might have helped someone through their toughest times but at that moment it would simply be disregarded as “just telling obvious things that anyone would have said”, “I just happened to be there and anyone else could have done the same thing”. It’s fascinating how this happens though. It could be rooted in my childhood where I observed the pattern that once I fail to do one task, I was considered a failure regardless of the other tasks that I have done. As I have said earlier, this is not an inspection into why but rather a what can be done. Now once my mind has brought all of my work and everything I have done to zero value by categorizing the work as something that anyone could have done, it will come to a fun conclusion.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I put value on my life based on how much I’m capable of helping people. Now when the value of those helping moments are dimnished I have to come to the conclusion that my life itself has no value. What use is a life that is not useful to others. But that is only a perspective that I hold on to my life and only to it. I will not be thinking the same way of the people that I’m with. In fact I would thank them many times just for being there and that what they have done is quite unique and irreplacable.\nWhat exactly gives value to a life? Is it truly the work that they have done for the people around them, or is it based on the energy that they bring to the people around them? These are questions that would need to be discussed in length in the upcoming pages, but for now let’s explore the different ways that people value their lives. When given the question, what makes your life valuable? It raises a secondary underlying question? Why should a life be valued? The notion of a hierarchy is what brings forth a majority of inequalities and suffering. Instead of asking what makes your life valuable the real question would be to ask, what is your reason for living? If you are living simply because of someone else that is when you start giving a value to your life based on the usefulness that you have towrds others. But instead if you are living for your own self, then the value of your life only depends on the things that your heart yearns to do. And the heart can yearn for a lot of things. At our lowest moment, our heart yearns to feel connected. From what I have experienced, there is always an opportunity for a person to feel connected. Feeling connected does not necessarily mean that you need to be talking with people, although in my case that is how I connect with people. If that is the way you connect with people then you might want to stay tuned because even I’m at a loss when it comes to that stage. My initial hypothesis was that talking with people on the internet or even in a bar might be helpful. But it requires energy to get out of your low stage and walk or travel to the nearest place where people gather. That is why my next hypothesis was that it might be a good idea to simply go and join any random twitch stream and comment along with other people. You might feel a certain kindredship in the way that everyone is rooting for the same person to play the game in a certain way.\nThe games that people play are certainly interesting. You can meet a bunch of people that are playing a game of pool and you can simply be in the sidelines cheering along with the rest of the crowd and as they see your enthusiasm and your cheers, they slowly open up to you. It’s an interesting phenomenon that I have experienced in countries that are outside of the south asian region. It depends on the openness of the group that is playing to accept people from the outside. Generally if people are going in a tight knit group with only the idea of enjoying the moment with that group alone.",

    "text": "In the fears that the primitive human has given us, being alone is a significant one, similar to the fear of death. There are some who are able to live their lives in solitude and thrive in such an environment. There are also those who need human interaction to function. The term that people loosely use for this divide is extroversion vs introversion. The main idea that I have surmised and internalized after talking with many people about their individual definitions of extroversion vs introversion is that people who feel energized after spending time with groups of people are extroverted compared to introverts.\nAs it might be clear to anyone who interacted with me past high school would know, I am an extrovert. It was interesting to see the change in my behavior prior and post high school years. I believe it was during the time of hormonal storms that I decided to be introverted and shut myself off from the world while after the storm subsided I found joy in engaging with people. Discovering the stories that people have to say about their successes, their lessons learned, their failures, their hopes and dreams was truly gratifying.\nHowever after being put in a series of difficult situations I started to realize that I was being an extrovert in order to avoid the fear of feeling alone.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since I was little, I do not remember exactly when, I would be interested in a weird variety of topics and have the wildest dreams children can have. That is one of the sweet innocenct qualities that children possess, the naive optimism and whole hearted belief that things are possible if you try doing it. We dress up and act as our parents when we play tea party or play houses, even though we have zero knowledge on the actual weight of being a parent or a breadwinner. We simply know the individual traits and actions to mimic of certain characters. Similarly when we were little we would have high hopes on we would want to become. There was so much potential within us as we would loudly proclaim in a room full of strangers or acquaintances that we would one day be teachers, doctors, pilots, astronauts or engineers. We had no clue on the exact implications, the process, the requirements but we loved dreaming about them. We would do and act as if we were that person to embody that dream. And as anyone who is reading this already knows, those dreams soon fade away and are replaced with things and we never expected yet we enjoy or are neutral towards the things that we are currently doing.\nIn my early school days, I would be interested in a variety of hobbies. To put it short I would be doing robotics and electronics for a few months and then moving on to cardistry. It led to my parents believing that I would not commit to anything when I start something new, and I can’t blame them. After seeing a person not being able to commit many times, your internal bias starts growing that this person would always shift from one hobby to another. But I have stuck with a few hobbies that I found interesting, and all the hobbies that I left out gave me stories and experiences that I can use to relate to people from different areas.\nThis chapter is for those who are lost on feeling like they have a lack of purpose or they have too many opportunities and can’t pick any. While it is possible such a person might have an Attention Deficiency Disorder where they have a hard time regulating attention, I would forego that usual recommendation to go seek medical help and talk about how to make the best and accept the situation we are in. Why would I avoid the usual recommendation? For one, if you can make the best out of the hand you have been dealt and you are happy and content with the life that you currently have and it is built in a way that is sustainable for you in the long run, is there a reason to seek medication to be a fraction of a finer version of yourself? And second I’m not a medical professional to diagnose your condition to simply put the fear of a mental condition in your head. However, if by following other’s advices you still seem to struggle and your current condition is negatively affecting your life constantly, I would suggest that you go and seek medical attention. The bottom line is that what I have to give in this chapter are my thoughts and exercises that I use to handle my situation and it is of noway an fool proof guide or a litmus test for mental conditions.\nNow after that train wreck of a derailment, let’s get on with the rest of the conversation. What were we talking about? Chasing dreams and choosing opportunities. Well in life what I have found out to be the main lesson in my search was that, anything you learn will be of use someday, even if it shapes the way that you percieve or act upon a task. An student learning to be an accountant decides to switch careers and becomes a chef. Does that mean all of his knowledge in balancing ledgers are gone to waste? Probably, but the foundational skills of seeing the finer details, making comparisons and processing information in a faster way might be helpful when they are dealing with new recipes, food or even if they start their own restaurant. It could be that the student didn’t actually gain any skills from the accounting class, but still it might just provide a good icebreaker over a fellow workmate, or even a prospective partner in the future. In my native tongue there is a saying which translated means, “The one thing that thieves or your enemies can’t steal from you are the knowledge and skills you have gained”. While it is quite a useful saying for a parent who wants to encourage their children to study harder, it does also have a bit of wisdom in it. For those who feel like they have been set back in time because they wasted so much time learning something useless, just know that those skills will come in handy someday, everyone is on their own timelines and we decide how we want to play the hands we have been dealt. People who might be ahead of you in the new career that you are stepping in to might have spent ages honing their skills in that area but you also have something that you bring to the table. It might be a set of small napkins but those napkins might be the reason that someone gets to have a clean meal.\nIf the case is that whatever you learn will be useful to you in the end, what should someone do when feeling lost of having no purpose or having too many opportunities to pick from? Pick one and strive hard at it and see if it fits you. Yes I hear your woes of not having enough time. Time is running out, yes, and employers won’t hire people who are near retirement age, yes, and therefore you need to take the best decision that you can make right now to get to the top as fast as possible. The question then becomes, is it the case that when you do find the thing that you love, it would be difficult to make a living out of it because people would not be willing to pay for it? That might be true in certain professions, but I believe wholeheeartedly with the innocent child in me that there will always be a way to make a standing for yourself and earn enough to live a content life. Mind you it might not be a luxurious life, but it might be enough for you to survive. Life isn’t easy when you bring money into the picture. Money brings a lot of imbalances and injustices to this world. It might not be entirely the fault of money but it does have a say in how your life is structured.\nComing back to our original question and answer, there is a certain idea that Cal Newport had brought up in his book, “So good they can’t ignore you”. His idea was that in summary, you should not chase your passions and instead should work hard on one thing until you become passionate about it. This brings us back to the original topic of how children proclaim their passion. They have no clue of what is needed to be a pilot, they just learned what the letter G looks like much less feel multiples of them on their body as they fly an aircraft. Our passions are determined when we are young by the idea of being a certain person, not the by the idea of having to work hard to be that person. A child sees a violinist on stage and falls in love with the idea of being able to create such wonderful music. His passion is to be a violinist and then he decides to pick up the violin and learn it. Lo and behold the sound of screaming cats fill the room in the first attempt. The setback doesn’t bother him as he keeps on practicing determined to be the person he wants to be. But everyday his practices drive him further away from that dream as he realizes how much he has to learn. Evidently he gives up on it. On the other hand he picks up the flute just because he could whistle a bit and gives it a go. He has no vision or any high standard of who he wants to be. He is simply focused on having fun blowing wind into the flute. Little by little, it gets to him that he is capable of something as he focuses primarly on just playing the flute. Soon he’s playing in the same stage as the violinist that he once aspired to be but in the wind section.\nSo what was the lesson here? Pick one task, focus on the present moment and focus on the foundational skills and find enjoyment in it, use your dreams as a rudder but never as a whip on yourself. Eventually things will fall into place. Time is running out for everyone, money is hard to come by, but if we were to die tomorrow tragically, wouldn’t we rather die living a content life than a rich one?",

    "text": "Where do I even begin? There’s already so many books out there about the different methods and techniques to meditate. Add on top of that a dozen or so more books on building habits and staying consistent. What in the world could I possibly offer that has not already being covered in such a vast majority of literature?\nSimple. I will walk through you what I feel and what I think about, so that it gives you a bit of clarity on whether what you are feeling is valid or even better yet whether what I’m feeling is invalid or not.\nBefore we begin, I must bring forward a tid bit of my past relationship with meditation. I must for a chapter without a few personal anecdotes would be incomplete. My relationship with meditation started when I was first interested in getting rid of the thoughts that began to take center stage in my mind as I was going through puberty. The whole reason why I got into it will be detailed out in a separate chapter. For now, bear with me. In my earliest meditation practices, I was told that the mind is like a fish thrown out of water, desperately jumping here and there and never settling. I was told that the mind was a bull that is running here and there madly and meditation was the leash that you use to tie to the center. And as the bull struggles more and more you slowly shorten the leash to bring the bull closer. Mind you, I was 16 years old at this time and I accepted the argument that yes my mind is the enemy that I must conquer somehow. And that ladies and gentleman is where I got off on the wrong foot to begin with. I trained hard to meditate. I was trying my best to stay consistent and I would have long meditation sessions some even spanning to 30 or more minutes of sitting in one place and waging war with my mind trying to tame it. The word tame is an interesting choice coz some of the Buddhist texts that I grew up with had phrases that had similar meaning to taming or subduing your mind. However, as you might find out in other chapters, this sort of extensive battling with my mind ended up with my mind breaking and snapping back at me, driving me to my first suicide attempt. After that incident, I stepped out of Theravada Buddhism and meditation for a while and began searching for the true meaning of meditation. It was once I was out there looking at other forms of Buddhism and meditation that I started to get an idea about what exactly was to be done with meditation.\nYour mind is not your enemy. Let me make that perfectly clear here. You are not waging a war. There are no enemies. Remove the judgement that you have in your head towards whatever quality that you seek to get rid of through meditation. Meditation isn’t a way to destroy or make your mind work right. It is simply for you to observe and be aware of your mind.\nI have a really vague memory of a story that I once learned back when I was learning about meditation that made a lot more sense now. One time, a monk (I’m not sure if it was Lord Budhha or not) was walking with one of his followers and witnessed a sort of a circus show done by a man who was capable of standing on the top of a pole with just the tip of his finger. The monk told his follower, “Imagine you are that performer with your entire focus on that one single point. Now let go of that one point. That is similar to what happens with meditation”.\nIn meditation, what I do is to simply first make peace with myself. As someone who has dealt with a lot of negative self talk and went through depression and sucidal thoughts, the first thing you need to be is kind to yourself. When I was first learning meditation in the temple, I always wondered why would anyone need to be kind to themselves? Isn’t that something that people always do by default? Little did I know that there is actually a possibility for a person to fully despise themselves to the point of hating the very breath that they take in. Life can be full of surprises and the naive optimism of a young child always amazes me.\nThe way I calm myself is by first focusing on my legs and telling myself gently and kindly to relax my legs and I purposefully relax my legs with a clear intent. And I work my way upwards to my head. As I get more and more used to this routine, I have the tendency to try and speed up the process by instructing myself quickly to relax myself. And that is where I catch myself and start again to slow myself down and reassure myself that we are not running out of time.\nThis is another point where I would want to talk more about. The Buddhism that I knew when I was young always talked about making haste because the time you have on this life is precious and you must meditate and work towards nirvana without any delay. While I understand the sentiment, I believe there should be a small fine print underneath that says “Hey you should make haste, seize the day and what not, but do it slowly. Make haste, slowly. Take your time, be kind to yourself, every step you take is still valuable, you are not late, there is always time, just keep at it and you will get to a better place than before”.",

    "text": "I was never a writer to begin with. To be fair, when we are little we do not have predetermined artistic desires blessed upon us by the muses. My earliest creative aspirations was in drawing funnily enough. It was a peaceful and easy way for my parents to pacify me whenever they needed to keep me occupied. Simply put a box of crayons and sheets of papers infront of me and I would be content for the entire time period. I did get carried away with my drawing obsession soon enough to the point that I would use drawing as a distraction from the actual studying or exam preparation that I was supposed to do. Sadly though, despite my best efforts I still to this day lack the skills to be a good artist. The first obstruction I had when I first started was that I would find it difficult to decide on which colors to choose, leaving behind a trail of line drawings that my sister would sometimes take into her hand to color. However, with time I started develop a slight sense of how colors work as I moved to the graphic design and eventually I was able to understand how the colors should match in a design upto a certain level, however by that time I was unable to make any good looking line drawings. In life you gain one skill at the expense of losing one skill I believe, even though the former skill might be heavily dormant and requires a massive amount of work to get back into a working state. There was a brief period of time where I decided to revive the skill with an obsession on learning how to draw human figures in Japanese manga drawing style. This led to a wide variety of portraits that I drew by looking at reference images and tutorials online.\nApart from drawing, another creative obsession that began during my young years was the ability to write. It was first inspired I believe when I used to keep a small notebook containing different thoughts and quotes that my mind came up with. Eventually I had racked up about 4 80 page A6 notebooks that contained myraid thoughts and observations. It was fascinating to look back and see the first tell tale signs of my writing career. Soon the short thoughts became poems and I wrote many poems in my native language. However, for a period of time my creative writing aspirations were put on hold as a new found obsession in computer science made me focus primarily on honing the logical thinking hemisphere of my brain. Luckily, after coming to college and as I began looking at life in a novel perspective, my creative flair rose back in the form of short stories and attempts at novels. And as the drawings have gone the short stories and novels never actually saw an end or a completion of any sort. I do not know if I can call myself a writer with only a handful of poems that are available online and no actual published work, self published even. Regardless I shall try to write and finish a book someday and I hope this book becomes the one that I finally get to finish.\nApart from creative writing, through out my academic career I have always been required to write articles, papers in a academic writing setting. The main difference I see in academic writing compared to creative writing is the change of voice in my head. The words that pour through my fingers are directed by a small voice that is telling me what to write next. That same voice is what’s powering the words you see on this book. When I’m told to write an academic article, the voice changes drastically to a somewhat of a careful, tactical voice with a slight pinch of pompousness mixed into it. I’m not exactly sure what causes this shift in tone in the voice inside my head, perhaps it’s the way that I read the academic articles that make me mimic the same tone that I read the papers in. I do try to bring my creative voice into the academic writing setting but it very rarely mixes well and quite often the more logical voice takes over as I pour out more of the theoretical aspects of my work.",

    "text": "I do not know how to structure this. But I want to pursue writing up things that that I learned from my every day happenings as sort of learned lessons for my future child to read and see that life isn’t always linear. Everyone is understanding things and growing as they go in life.\nDate: 16th February 2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nThe weather is becoming more colder even though it’s supposed to be the height of summer. Waking up was hard today as it was a nice cold Sunday morning and the tendency to just roll over and sleep was too high. I had to promise myself that I would get out of bed at 07:15AM and show up to my laptop and keyboard to write this. When we are young promises mean a lot for us. It’s a sign of putting trust on to others, and also a way to receive trust on to yourself. When you are young, you will make promises to others and others will make promises to you as well. At first you would expect those around you to keep their promises and at a certain point you will realize that most promises don’t take promises seriously. That is where the tendency comes to promise things to yourself but have no serious obligation in your head. That is where the first steps to lying to yourself starts. From there onwards anytime you promise yourself that you would stop doing a bad behavior or that you would start doing a good behavior, it will be hard for you to keep the promise. Because you have seen others dismiss promises and consider them as simple statements, and you have seen how you would promise things to others and not follow through with it. Slowly just like that you start lying to yourself. It’s crucial that you do not follow this pattern. The first step to surviving in this world is to have yourself on your side and for that you need to foster a trusting relationship with yourself. So keep in mind when you make promises to yourself, only make the promises that you know you wholeheartedly can do and if you do make a promise, follow through with it to the end.\nAside from that, carving out a path for yourself requires a lot I will say that for sure. Right now I am at a place where I need to stand strong on my idea and push forward with it while taking in the feedback of others in a healthy manner. It’s rough I must say, but it is necessary for us to be able to form an opinion of our own. It can be a struggle to find a solid foundation to rely on but do not let that discourage you. As long as you learn how to put your effort in at the right time and to go with the flow the rest of the times, it can be a lot easier to navigate. When is the right time to put in the effort and when is the right time to go with the flow. Well my dear, I wouldn’t be able to find that answer for you. Only advice I can give is to listen objectively. Listen to your body objectively, listen to others objectively, listen to your mind objectively. Your body can rarely lie but your mind and those around you can. Ask nicely and your body shall respond.\nDate: 17.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nFor some reason falling asleep when needed is a lot difficult than it may seem on the surface. I always wonder what people think about when they fall asleep. Do they think about their loved ones? Do they think about the day to be conquered tomorrow? or the day that they regret today? Do they think about the dramas and plays that they witnessed in the day itself? I will not know for sure what others are thinking, for me I try my best to picture you as best as I can to imagination. If ever you doubt whether you were the same as I imagined the answer will always be, no, you were better than what I always imagined.\nThere’s always an enjoyment in progressively getting better at things and finding out new things to be good at is always fun. Perhaps one of the best reasons to do something is to do it because it is good for you and doesn’t harm those around you and you can keep on doing it into the future reaping the benefits of what you sowed. Might not seem motivational but in most cases whatever reason you hold on as the motivation has a tendency to either change drastically for the good and for the bad. In some cases you might realise that the reason that motivated you was not actually a healthy reason to be motivated. If you ever come across a moment like that my dear, just know that it’s a feeling that I experienced quite a lot in my life. The first thing you must refrain from is beating yourself up and doubting all the progress that you made so far. When a foundation that you stand on gets taken out from you, you need to have yourself on your side first and foremost before anyone else joins your side. While the motivating factor might not have been suitable, progress is still progress, and mitigating the damage will take time and patience, but now that you have a clearer mind and a loving self, the future is going to be brighter I promise.\nAlso if ever you come across something that ignites a childlike smile in you, go experience that. I can guarantee you, there will be a brief moment of euphoria and after that whether or not you continue feeling it every time will be questionable but it will be a lovely reminder for you to love the inner child within you.\nDate: 18.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nWell it seems I have been bested and my ego is shattered. I thought I was right and the ideas of others were wrong. It might be the case that I can be right and wrong at the same time while also having the others be right and wrong at the same time. This is where I guess the notion of such cut and dry dualities become gray. It also could be that I am too proud to accept that I thought wrong. It might not be surprising to you my dear, to hear that your old man was a proud person. Nevertheless, I will accept this defeat with dignity. However, there’s more to the story now that I made this tiny progress in the research. As to where and how the story will go is still a mystery to me as well.\nA surprising comment caught me off guard while I was having a chat with a friend of mine. “I wouldn’t want to share my eggs and cucumbers with anyone yet.” It was interesting to think that being single gives you this freedom to pursue life in a way that is completely within your control and definitions. You might also come to an age and wonder “why should I give up being single for someone else?”. And truth be told at the age that your old man is at now, he has no idea either. Although I must say I do fall easily for people but that is because I tend to forget the freedom that I take for granted. Perhaps with the right person it shouldn’t feel like the freedom is taken away and maybe it feels a lot like there’s a bit more color to the monotone freedom in your life.\nIs life simply a never ending cycle of having something and taking it for granted and then losing that said thing proceeded by an eternal fight to gain it again only to lose it after taking it for granted? Perhaps, that might be the case. As Zen Buddhists would say at your purest form your mind is said to be calm and free and yet we introduce so many other things that bring in a series of pain and suffering.\nDate: 19.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nWorking early morning does help it seems. I actually made some progress in the work that I was doing and to be honest it felt a lot more lively and less stressful than working late night. Something about me is slowly shifting I guess, and I’m glad that shift is happening. For you my dear there will come a point in time where you will be working all night long and still be able to function properly the next few days. Cherish those moments, because with time that skill becomes harder to maintain. Despite what people might say about playing to your energy levels, working late would be a bad idea if you have a bad history with it as your old man does.\nSpeaking of bad history, I’m still not ready to fight back against the bullies within the walls of my family. I hope to god that by the time you are reading this I have either fought back or the bully had let go of their ways. Either way I have strengthened my resolve when presented with snide remarks of my self image by knowing that I look good to myself regardless of whatever happens to my self image. If my dear someday you want to love someone unconditionally, first love yourself in a way that no matter the mistakes or slip ups that you have that you will love yourself in the same way no matter what. In other news, your old man may appear tough at times but know that he would cry over stories told in the big screen easily. Perhaps the most poignant set of events that affects me is the case of the misunderstood person shunning himself from the crowd and not being able to face them is able to face them with slow build up of courage. Perhaps there might be some link to my social anxiety or perhaps it’s something deeper within me that finds this connection. Even though I might appear as someone who would always talk and check up on people, internally I too am scared to talk to people sometimes. It takes a bit of effort on my end to talk to people because of a variety of reasons sometimes. It can be scary to be on a journey alone. For me whenever I see the stars at night I find companionship with them, where I would be greeting Orion and mapping out the rest of the night sky in reference to Orion. On some days it is mapped out through with the centaur. Have some small moments of whimsy in your life. See the beauty in the ordinary by letting go of your preconceived expectations and experiencing the moment fully. It might be a small flower blooming in between the rough concrete or it could be the traffic lights turning green in front of a tapestry of velvety clouds. Carving a path for yourself can be scary at times. But at all times what’s necessary is to understand what your strengths are and hone them. You might not know what your strengths are, the people around you might not know some parts of it, but there is always the case where you might have strengths that haven’t been explored at all or didn’t have the right time and guidance to be your strength. Whatever it is know that every step you take will be helping you reach a place of satisfaction, because surprisingly we get to decide where our place of satisfaction is at.\nDate: 20.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt is true that when you announce to the world that you are doing something, every possible method of resistance will come forth to deny you of what you are trying to achieve. This is why I think the archers in Japan would say that you have to release the arrow without realizing it. The moment you force it and announce it to the world then it would drain you out in reaching the target. Should you be hiding your ambitions and goals in fear of this resistance? Not at all my dear, simply know that there will be a resistance and that it is an indication that you need to make the process as natural as possible.\nIf ever you feel like your old man isn’t scared of anything and is the toughest cookie you have seen in the world, just know that there are days when your old man would go and get the sweetest doughnut and milkshake possible to calm himself before a meeting that he’s anxious about. This is after he is trying his best to cut out sugar as much as possible.\nAdding on to how scared your old man is, he was scared of moments where his friend circles would combine as well and he was scared of telling the truth to one friend that he’s hanging out with another friend instead. These are things that I’m still trying to grow out of with the help of slowly putting myself out there. The fear of rejection and being left alone is strong no matter what. So know that you are not alone, to feel alienated and left alone is to be human as well much like its counterpart. Have faith in yourself that you would retain the friends that would be by your side in times of need.\nYour old man used to drink a lot back in the day. I think that should have been pretty obvious to you as well. On the beginning of this year I decided not to drink again for three months. At first it was presented as a challenge by a friend that I do not consider a close friend anymore, but later on I realized that this was sort of a practicing ground for me when you would be coming around in to the world my dear. And so I began and one month went by with triumphant glee. But as the end of the second month rolls around the stress rises high, it is clear that alcohol was a way for your old man to numb his pain and to escape from reality. It was a form of self harm after a while where I purposefully would reduce my thinking capabilities as a punishment for not being able to find a solution through the struggles that life had to offer. Regardless, your old man persisted to this day and has not sabotaged himself with alcohol and he would not be doing it in solidarity when you are coming around to this world.\nDate: 21.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI made it to this morning. Today is one of those days that made me say this out loud. I stood my ground yesterday and I realized that some people are not open to seeing a world view outside of their own. And at times like that I need to protect myself above all. I hope to god that I do not pass on the same trauma that I had to endure, but if I have, forgive me my dear, it was never my intention to do so. And if you are currently at a state where your self esteem is low and you are teetering towards the precipice of taking your own life, please take a moment to know that no matter who might find you unworthy you need to stay by your own side the most. Why you might ask, well simply put there’s still a life left to live and experiences to be had. There is still always something that can be done with the life that we have regardless of what gets taken away from us. Do not abandon the inner child within you, that child has already gone through enough as it is. Don’t pile on top of the damages that have already been dealt.\nI do not have a lot to talk about except that there were many moments your old man decided not to walk this earth anymore and take the final leap ahead of time. I hope by the time I get to know you most of these tendencies would be faint as it can get. It is quite comforting to abandon your child if that is all that you have known as the reality. But in reality there are people who might help out and it requires a phenomenal strength to take the first step to ask for help.\nTry your best not to doubt yourself based on one dimension of evaluation. You might not be good at something based on an arbitrary standard set by someone else, but you can be good at something else in the standard that you set by yourself. We are people with multiple facets. An art exhibition of sorts. Some paintings might not appeal to some and some paintings might not appeal to anyone but the fact that they came and the fact that as a collective you are not a bad art exhibition is undeniable. If there is at least one good quality in you, at least one good skill that you have, then hold fast to it. Even if we are to live in the most poorest state that we can, we will still somehow manage our lives.\nI promise you that I will live to see you someday.\nDate: 22.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI made it to this morning as well. Yesterday was difficult in terms of the emotions that I had to deal with through out the day. First came a puppet with the face of a martyr that I had to deal with, and then came the two injuries that happened on the badminton court. It is interesting to think that your old man would take responsibility of people falling over and spraining their ankle when he booked the badminton court. Logically, yes it doesn’t make sense for me to be guilty for the injury that I didn’t accidentally cause. However, there is the emotional component that makes me feel that this wouldn’t have happened if…. and that is where I get stuck. There is nothing for me to do. It was simply out of my control. Yet I want to take responsibility for it. Why? I’m not certain either. Perhaps by the time you are reading this I might have a better idea but for now all I know is that it’s easier to blame myself than to blame bad luck. Perhaps it is my trauma from my childhood where I would be blamed when the electronics didn’t work in the house. Regardless I need to accept that I did the best I can do to make sure that everyone was kept safe.\nThere will be times in your life when you are met with a strong feeling of abandonment. It could come when those you trusted to take your side in times of difficulty betrays you to take the side of the majority. At such times, keep in mind that everyone is doing it for the sake of their safety and while it may seem unfair it doesn’t do you any good to hate on them. First and foremost do not desert yourself in these times. Do what is necessary, healthy and sustainable for you to feel happy and loved at that moment. Do not be the tyrant that deprives you of the little joys in life for the sake of delaying gratification. When times are rough and there is an opportunity to make yourself feel loved as long as the price of having that joy doesn’t harm you in the long run.\nSometimes it’s good to let your anger out to a confidante that you trust to listen and not to judge. Men really need to build relationships with other men where they are free to cry and let their tears fall. It is a man’s innate nature to hold back their tears as that’s what was being taught since they are young (at least it was for me). The gender stereotypes that I grew up with might have vanished by now hopefully. If it is still prevalent in the society, it would take the form of “don’t cry like a girl”. The statement itself is nonsensical because the ability to cry is the first demonstration of life in a new born baby. They say that the first and last breath are the hardest to take and hence why we cry in pain in both moments. For those who decide to take their last breath ahead of time the cries of pain are more prominent closer to the act. In life you will need to decide when to take a break from putting in the extra effort for people that do not value your expertise. If you have no choice but to interact with these people then give them the bare minimum you need to give them while also feigning an empty poker face.\nDate: 23.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI’m feeling a lot better today I would say. Not much to give as a letter from yesterday apart from realising how much of a difference it makes to stay in the presence of someone and just kick back and relax compared to staying at home and trying to relax. Platonic friendships can be quite useful at times like this. Your old man has given up hope finding a partner at this stage so there is no way that I would be spending my time trying to court anyone. It is also fascinating to realise that you are not alone in the way you behave inside the house. Most people who live by themselves prefer to live in their house with a certain way that they would not want to change, and to be a good friend means to be able to accommodate that.\nAlso I hate the smell of cheese and I honestly do not find it appealing at this point.\nDate: 24.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nSometimes it’s freeing when you start living life purposefully. It starts with enjoying the most mundane moments of your life. It can be simply enjoying the stars at night, or it could be just seeing the contrasting colors of bright green leaves reaching up high into the dull gray skies.\nPeople used to say that your old man has a face that has subtitles underneath it all the time, because no matter what it was easy to read his emotions through his face. Perhaps that might still be the case and if that’s the case I hope you have not learned the skill of trying to read people based on their emotions. It is not a superpower at all, but merely a survival tactic learned in a household where emotions aren’t expressed or communicated properly. Hence why I hope you would never end up in such a position.\nIf you tend to have a negative outlook towards yourself, that same outlook would seep into how you view other people as well. You would consider their one mistake as the end of the relationship with them, which is why you fear making a mistake in a relationship and prepare yourself for abandonment, perhaps even premeditate the abandonment in a self fulfilling prophecy. I am someone of that sorts and I hope you are not. Life will throw you a bunch of the same lessons to learn when you realise how bad you are at something. For me these days it’s accepting people’s mistakes and their hurtful actions towards me. I would tend to invalidate all their past goodwill simply by one mistake they did because I would start questioning the past and its genuine nature. Perhaps this is because of how my childhood abuser would always provide a lot but in turn also weaponize them when abusing me. Perhaps I am only protecting myself, or I am projecting my fears onto them. Either way I will be trying to take this week slowly to fully understand what’s going in my head and how I approach people.\nDate: 25.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nYour old man is officially divorced and single now. The news didn’t come as a shock but rather a soft sigh. There’s a soft beauty in unspoken goodbyes. That is what I believe is the main story for this week.\nIt might already be obvious but your old man can be quite angry and stubborn at times. From a young age, I did not have the proper tools to let go of my anger. In a household where negative emotions are shunned, it is natural for the child to learn only passive avoidant ways of dealing with anger. Therefore for me it is difficult to understand what’s the right way to express my discomfort. It’s even worse when it’s against someone who I’m afraid of.\nDuring difficult time periods it can be easy to lose sight of the things that you can be grateful for and simply force yourself to target short term wins while sacrificing your health. That was a fact, but the question on how you are going to avoid doing that is something I’m yet to find the answer for.\nYesterday was a barrage of unanswered questions that I will hopefully find the solution to slowly.\nDate: 26.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nThere’s a lot of people supporting your old man, I must say my dear. As much as I hate the outside world, sometimes I forget that there are people to support me if I get stuck with mr problems.\nThat being said your old man is also very scared to take unorthodox decisions, or decisions that will put him at a place of social scrutiny. It literally sends shivers down my spine when I have to take a choice to be an independent person. It’s not easy, yet it is even more harder for my overanalyzing brain that worries about every little detail that could happen as a result of my decision.\nOne thing I will tell you from the time you are growing up, my dear, sugar is a devil that you should associate gently. Know that while you are young you might be able to excessively consume it, but with age comes a bigger health risk that I simply cannot emphasize. If you are coming close to your 20s my dear, please consider cutting out the sugar in your life slowly. You will realize how difficult it is to cut the sugar out but it takes time.\nAs a final closing note, perhaps one of the most difficult things to do in life is to carve out your own path. I believe I was raised to believe that if you say no to someone’s help then you will never have that person’s help in the future. So it is a bit difficult for me to comprehend a world where I travel alone and do my own thing and be good at it.\nSo if you are struggling now to figure out your life, my little one, know that your old man is still struggling even when he’s near 30 years old.\nDate: 27.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nYesterday was trippy little one. I had to confront a lot of the doubts and fears that have been circling my mind. At the time of writing this, I do not think I would be seeing you in the future, nor will you exist to read these. So I would have to drop these series to make sure I do not exhaust myself and give unnecessary hope.\nIt is sad but at the moment I believe my life would be best targeted towards me reaching towards the goal of finding peace within me and I doubt it would be made easy unless I commit to it now. Perhaps there might be a flaw in the way that I am thinking where I do not need to take on this path by committing in this manner. The only analogy I have for everything right now is to think of it in terms of archery, and in this case, I think instead of committing to something right now planning for something at the end of the process seems forced and unnatural. If I were to go with the flow and be detatched in letting the archer and archery be separated I think it might be best for me to not jump to conclusions up front. So instead I will be focusing on sharing what I learn about finding inner peace with you my little one.\nDate: 28.02.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nEveryday I get new ideas and things that I can do to get through the issues that I am struggling with. I will always say this, I am forever grateful for the friends that I have around me right now, despite what they might do in the future, right now I am grateful and glad that I have them.\nI am yet to figure out how to get my life back int otits previous form. Perhaps we might not be able to always perform the same routine through out the time as there will be days where you are not in the best mood to start your day in an upbeat format. For now I think we might need to focus on sleeping at an earlier time to properly fix my sleeping schedule.\nPerhaps in addition to these letters I can work on writing a small novel to read to you when you are little. I don’t know if you want to listen to your old man’s stories when you are young but I feel it would bring a bit of whimsy and beauty to mine and your life.\nGrowing up you will come to a time where you would forcefully stay away from things that you enjoyed it, in fear of being addicted to it. In such cases, if it brings an innocent joy to you, or if you are at a place where there aren’t a lot of things that bring joy to your life, it might actually be benficial to actually get into that activity that gives you joy. Have faith in yourself that you are capable of staying true to yourself and staying away from the addiction. Sometimes we strive hard trying to avoid being the state of flight, freeze, fight or fawn but we never stop to consider that sometimes these mechanisms are there for a reason and it might be necessary for us to calm ourself rather than to strive against it.\nDate: 01.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nYour old man is technically two months sober. It was not easy as I thought it would be. Perhaps the most difficult part was the constant reminders all around in mass media and everyday life. Not to mention the friends suggesting to drink. So far have I gained any special abilities and such? Nope the only ability I obtained was to look for alternatives to numb the emotional and mental pains that I had to deal with.\nI still struggle to fix my sleeping schedule. I stay up watching movies that I have watched, or trying to find new ones to watch, all the while shoving unhealthy servings of sugary treats. Sugar is menance I will tell you that much. It’s a quick fixer when you are feeling sad or any other negative emotion. It’s a crutch basically and fighting against it is difficult when you also have the trauma to work against as well.\nI will need to get my life in order today and figure out the path forward, while also being kind to myself and taking care of myself. It’s tough but reinventing yourself every week by reassessing who you are is a crucial thing to do I feel. Above all I need to rethink where I am going with the research work that I am doing, and to think of an outlet to pour my creative writing strengths to.\nThese are all good questions that I hope to answer someday, but until then, I will keep on looking.\nDate: 02.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt’s getting harder to wake up early and get on with the day with haste. I might be sleep deprived and still recovering or it could be the sudden loss of sugar that’s causing me to be lethargic. If this is what it means to be a dependent on sugar then I believe sugar is worse of an addiction compared to alcohol.\nI believe I overwhelm myself quite easily by putting too much emphasis on one day and the requirement to finish all my work on a given day where if I succuumb to the desire to rest or engage in anything frivolous I would panic extensively on the day slipping between my hands. The concept that Time is finite while literally might be motivating it can be also quite demoralising when your body demands rest or when your mind demands to freeze while stuck in the throes of an emotional flashback.\nIn my opinion, my dear little one, it’s best to take the route that is kinder and loving to yourself. Take care of yourself to make sure that you have food to eat, a clean bed and area to live, clean clothes to wear and contentment in life to keep on going forward.\nIn our pursuit of liberation from wordly desires we tend to forget that by looking inward and loving ourselves we maybe closer to understand the world around us. For the wave is part of the ocean while also being a part of its own.\nDate: 03.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nToday was supposed to be the start of a new lifestyle but I belive there was something fundamentally wrong with the way I approached it. I did not have any motivation in me to get out of the bed, and I was not excited about the prospect of starting a new day today. I was stuck in an emotional flashback and I really didn’t get around to investigating what the underlyig trigger for the trauma was that made me freeze up. However, it did help to simply get myself out of bed by reminding myself that being kind to yourself does not mean letting myself do whatever I want, that’s basically neglecting myself. It was at that moment that I was able to get out of bed.\nDoing breathwork in the morning is a definite good thing to wake myself up. The Wim Hof method is what I have been using since my archery days and I hope by the time you are reading this that method or better methods exists as well. The world is slowly starting to understand the value of breathing with intention to shape our lives.\nAlso I do not worry too much about the sugar content of my cereal anymore as I realized that most of my sugar cravings are an underlying need for comfort. Therefore, the next time I find myself craving for food the first thing I need to do is to calm myself to see if the need for comfort is coming from a traumatic flashback and I’m trying to numb the pain or is it a genuine desire for something sweet. It is true that food makes us feel safe and happy and that’s why when we are stressed we would tend to overeat to make ourselves feel safe. I wonder if in the animal kingdom there are animals that would exhibit this behaviour.\nNow onto the meditations. 10 minutes is a long and hard time to meditate I must say. Right now based on what I have learned in my lifetime I have decided to simply breathe and exist and reiterate that I am deserving of love as a starting point to spreading kindness to myself and others.\nDate: 04.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI managed to wake up at 6 surprisingly.\nMy meditations today was about being at peace with the silence. I think the more I worked with shutting down my inner critic the more I learned how to bring silence into my own headspace. There was a spot of time where it was absolutely silent except for my breathing. It was a peaceful feeling that I would love to experience again. Loving myself includes accepting my flaws as it is and understanding that for each flaw that I have there are many more good characteristics that make me who I am.\nIn life when in pursuit of minor gains we tend to forget that some of these minor gains are only effective in a small portion of our time here on earth. The rest of the time is driven by simple yet hard to achieve things such as kindness and honesty. If ever you get stuck trying to figure out what to focus on my little one in your life, be a kind person to yourself first and foremost and then onto others. We are quick to say to be kind to others without prefacing ourselves. If we are not kind to ourselves it’s quite easy to fall victim to other people expoiting our time, energy and kindness to the point that we start despsising the topic of being kind itself.\nYour old man has seen his fair share of insecure men in his time. Men who fear their partner leaving them at any moment and men who try too hard to keep a pristine positive image of themselves to the outside world. If by any chance my little one you come across these types of men (and there are many more types to be aware of) do not spend unnecessary amount of energy trying to get them to the right path. Guide them yes but do not expect them to follow. Sometimes rejection and failure can be the greatest teacher to some men to realize what they have been doing wrong.\nDate: 05.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI should not have pushed myself that intensely last night.\nI was able to be at peace with the silence for a while and I was able to get to that state quicker than before. However I could not maintain it for a long time and I eventually had to end the session early. After doing the breathwork in a sleep deprived state it is difficult to focus my mind for long.\nPerhaps the biggest issue with sleep deprivation is that our inner and outer critics become stronger and prominent than ever. For example this entire morning your old man was coming up with scenarios where he would be rejected by those who he work with and he would have to find a different place to work with. While we do not know whether that would happen definitely there was no point in me going through that scenario simply because I knew my worth and what I’m capable and not capable of. Surprisingly this epiphany came to me from a Youtube comment, where a random troll was saying a certain member of the channel was not good when that member was not present in the video. It made me realize there will be so many people that will just say that you are not good enough or that you are not worthy, but as long as you know your worth and know what you are capable of there’s no need to heed the thoughts of others. I do understand in retrospect I did make up a scenario in my head and resolved it in my head as well.\nOn another note, I hope when you are reading these I have been a supportive person in your life to the point that you felt comfortable telling me everything that you are feeling during your periods of stress no matter how minor it might be. I had to dust myself off and pat myself on the back many a times in my life. I hope that you get to learn to do that as well by yourself but at moments where you can’t be I hope that I would stay true to my word and be there by your side.\nDate: 06.03.2025 To: The one after my own heart\nToday was a good day.\nI am writing this recollection after most of the events in my day has already transpired. In a way it turned out for the best.\nIn life there will be moments where the end goal is of the least importance but what matters is the things you learn along the way. In my lifetime that was always the case, but for you it might be different. For me at least, I learned about supplementary skills and networked with people during my time in school and in the university and now in my time doing this postgrad I can sense that my destiny is also directed towards that side.\nAlso it is hard to understand what you don’t like especially and what you do like instead ( which is the harder question because sometimes the thing that you think that you want might not be healthy and in some cases might not be the thing that you actually truly want ). Life will always be a case of letting go of structures that you have held in your head and understanding what works best for you. Not everyone achieves the same goal in the same way and you most likely won’t be achieving similar goals.\nIt’s all right if you don’t get to achieve the daily goals that you have set up for yourself. Do not try to make your passion projects into a chore. Reignite the passion within you by sort of diving back into what you have done so far and on some days its completely fine if you have not made any progress or even attempted to make any progress. Even today I do not have any insights on meditations to share, except I got into a chat with a friend of mine ( who I hope I still am in contact with, at the rate that friends come and go, I can not tell honestly ) and understood how the schedule I once would have wanted to follow as a monk is actively being followed by people for a 10 days compared to the one day practice that I have seen back home. It is an insane task to take up but would be a fun novel experience to take on.\nYour old man thrives on novelty, and being in a room full of people, and also telling stories. I am truly sorry if I have bored you to death with all the stories that I have retold to you by the time you are reading this. Knowing that about me helps me a lot to figure out where I want to invest my time in. When you are starting out you have to spend your time trying to figure things out by trying them out. It might seem like a waste but they are all valuable lessons on understanding what you like and do not like about yourself.\nThat’s all I have remember for today. Today was such a packed day.\nDate: 07.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt is interesting how quickly friends will come and go in our lives. At this rate I would not be surprised if half of the people I talk about in these letters are no longer friends with me. Regardless, what I have to give to you as advice my dear is to love yourself and be comfortable with yourself to the point that being in a place with no friends does not put you in a state of distress. It will be hard. I do not know what orientation you would take be it introverted or extroverted when you grow up. Regardless, I hope you grow up in a state where being alone does not bother you severely.\nDate: 08.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nWhen you are growing up I hope that I do not ever make you feel guilty or fear punishment when you break something in the house or break something that someone else owns. Still to this day, my trauma response is to flight and freeze. Basically in a stressful situation your old man would always run away from the situation and start finding ways to numb the pain and fear that is coursing through him. I hope you get to identify and understand early on the ways that you react to stressful situations so that you can identify which ones are good and bad and which ones are a response to a deeper problem that you are trying to suppress.\nI hope that when you are all grown up, I don’t ramble on and try to tell you advice without considering your situation. If it ever does, I hope you call your old man out. A lot of times in life, I tend to be unaware of the subtle hidden messages that I am sending. I can also be unaware of how much I am talking and how it’s being percieved by others. I have lost many a friend because of incidents where I had said something insensitive that I didn’t pick up and most of the times those at the receiving end do not call it out when they are comfortable and would much rather prefer to keep it deep within them until they can’t hold all of it anymore.\nSometimes it’s all right to not be always physically active. Somedays you will rot in bed as a 30 year old adult by yourself gaining mindless brain numbing shots of dopamine. Just make sure that you notice them early on and also set boundaries that you would keep to yourself without lieing to yourself.\nDate: 09.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nOh how little I knew about the intricacies of society my little one. Your old man is learning a lot even in his late twenties. Do not fret if you feel like you are behind in life ever. We are all being exposed to new experiences everytime in our lives. The question is how are we going to interpret these experiences and what are we going to understand from them.\nI came across several fathers the past few days and I must say (I recently started noticing that I say this term quite a lot) there’s a certain aloofness and embarassing humour about each and every one of them. Perhaps even though the term dad jokes have been obliterated into an excuse to say risque jokes, dad jokes are what every dad finds humorous. I wonder if I too will become that someday.\nIn life there will be many instances where you will feel as if you can not keep up a routine at all. However do not lose hope and keep on trying to get back on to the same routine and adjust the routine based on the failures that you have noticed. For me I shall keep trying to wake up at 7 and take on the day with vigour.\nRegardless I hope that when you are little and if you go through something that you can not fully understand or if someone aflicts you with a pain and emotions that you do not understand or want to feel, you will have the feeling of safety to open up to me. I will try my best to create that space for you my little one but if I fail I hope you do still get to open up to me later into your life no matter what happened in your childhood.\nSometimes to get through something you have to quit you have to go through the depths of it and come outside of it a new man who has learned the valuable lessons needed for the future.\nDate: 10.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nThe theme for these days will primarily be about friends my little one, for some reason they tend to take up most of the space on my mind and I can not for the life of me seem to silence my mind. As I have said in a previous letter, friends come and go and right now I need to find peace with it. It’s hard as we are wired to be social creatures. But I wonder how do those dedicated to living a monastic life find the capability to live alone away from civilisation. Or is it the case that as the Buddhist saying goes, “To be born from the mud, to be raised by the mud, to stay with the mud but at the same time to be separated from the mud is the way of the lotus”. Perhaps life is about making peace. There’s a moment’s peace as we are born and then we are thrust into a never ending battle of finding peace within ourselves to venture through life. I hope that someday when you grow up, you would not find boundaries set by others as a sign of hostility but rather a sign of respect. To care or respect for someone is to also let them know when they are hurting you. There’s a fine line between an accusation, the setting of a boundary and feedback. Most people will resort to accusations when feedback is what they were intending, while some will receive the setting of a boundary as an accusation. I am of the latter and I am still trying to fix it. If I still am doing it when you are reading these I hope you can call it out. I understand that children should not be their parent’s caretakers or therapists, hence why I’m writing them upfront to work on them.\nDate: 11.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nPerhaps I am slipping from my usual fortitude and healing that I have built from the previous months. But I do feel like there are creative endeavours that I have not fully pursued. I think I need to reinforce it everyday and solidify the notes and highlights that I have taken from the workbook on complex PTSD. Waking up early is hard but if I can finetune the wake up message that should be better. Working out early in the morning, despite what others might say. It is hard I must say but it can be helpful.\nIt is weird I must say to encounter friends that you do not want to interact with in real life. But it’s good that I’m slowly building distance from those who I don’t want to deal with.\nDate: 12.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt is another one of those days where I have to announce that I chose to live to this morning. It’s all right to wave a white flag and succuumb to your pains sometimes. As much as we try to recover from our trauma bit by bit, we refrain ourselves from accepting defeat to keep our perfectionism intact. It is counterintuitive in the sense that in our journey to be kind to ourselves and accept ourselves as we are, we would try so hard to prevent ourselves from accepting failure.\nThese days will surely pass by and I will live through this surely. But at the moment, there’s a grim darkness that’s enveloping my judgement. I can not seem to shake it off leaving me with the only option of working alongside with it.\nIn life there will be times where you have to stand up against the self imposed authoritarian figures in your life.\nThink of the long run even though the prospect might seem scary at first take the leap. What would you have to lose?\nDate: 13.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nSomedays it helps to simply surround yourself with friends so that you don’t end up trapped in the same thought cycle for ages. Perhaps what we forget in times of distress is that there are friends who are willing to help even if its beyond their expertise simply because they care. It might not always be helpful but it is a relief to know that you are supported.\nA question that I never thought about was presented to me recently and it shook me to the core to think about it. “Whose death am I afriad to witness?”. After an entire night and morning of ruminating on my suicide, it actually was an eye opening question to flip the table and ask myself, if I believe that others will be all right after my death since I am a bad person and if everyone else out there is better than me, then I should be afraid of everyone’s death is that not the case? However at the moment my mind was drawing a blank as I had only tunnel visioned on my own demise but never on what I would do in the case of everyone else’s demise, especially my parents and all those that I try so hard to impress or see as an oppressing figure.\nI do not think this line of thoughts will stop me from spiraling downwards again, but I believe that I need to be aware of the inner critic becoming stronger again. Perhaps each morning if we can spend a few minutes simply silencing our thoughts before we start our day that would be absolutely beautiful. Even in your old man’s so called young days he still struggled to maintain a healthy morning routine. Perhaps when you come into my life I might have fixed a routine and would advice you to do so. The truth is, where there is no obligation the human mind would rarely do things out of sheer will.\nYou are loved. You are not alone. Not everyone out there is hating you. The advisor next to your throne is poisoning you and you need to be aware of your slimy advisor.\nDate: 14.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nLife gets better with time I promise you. With time you will slowly come to a routine that you will enjoy. Somedays you will get small wakeup calls that will let you know that you have to get back on the good habits that you built up for yourself. Being receptive to those would be really helpful.\nMy mind is scattered at the moment, so let me take a moment to arrange my mind to come up with what I learned the past few days. Sometmes it helps to reframe the thoughts you are having based simply on the language that you are using but its a hard habit to build honestly. What I mean by this is basically sometimes we can be subconsciously using a language that would be mean and bullying ourselves. Or in some cases it would be quite harsh towards others. At such moments it helps to see what exactly was the thing that was bothering you and whether it was actually conveyed through the words that you used.\nI still don’t know what my life’s purpose is. I thought it was to be remembered. I think right now my life’s purpose is to be at peace. That is all that I care about right now and I will make the career choices such that they bring me the most amount of peace. It’s a simple decision but I think that makes life a lot easier.\nThe theme of dealing with friendships and bridges being burned down continues. I still deal with friends becoming distant and I think the best practice right now is to build a life where I am not affected by living alone and going on my own path.\nDate: 15.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI don’t know if I will ever see you my little one.\nDivorce is a painful process. Your old man isn’t ready to open himself up for another person, and at the rate that I can see friendships fading, I think it’s best I make peace with being alone in the future. I’m sorry my little one, but I will not be able to see you. I will keep on writing these, for even if there was no one that would be after my own heart, I hope there will be someone who is closer to that place somehow.\nYour old man used to rely on alcohol to numb the pain that he felt in his life. Now with that crutch being taken away I have to resort to fully feeling the pain that I have balled up inside while making sure that I do not do anything harmful to myself along the way.\nI still question where am I in this short life of mine. After failing a marriage I doubt I’m capable of finding peace in another committed relationship. It’s hard I must say to be in a place where everyone is moving forward with their lives while you are stuck in this place. Do I have any words of wisdom to part with in case you are going through with this as well? Not exactly. For I am a cynic who has lost hope and I doubt I will be able to get that same hope back again.\nWhat I can say is find ways where you can feel the emotions that are growing inside you in a safe place. The world has a cliche view where if you are happy then you attract people who are happy. That might be true to some extent but in reality that might not be the case. You don’t have to lie and be someone else to make sure that you don’t lose the friends around you.\nThat being said, losing friends has become the norm now and I can already foresee from my negative mind when and where I will lose contact with my friends. It’s a bittersweet experience to build memories with your friends while knowing that the time with them will be severely limited. Soon everyone will go to their respective corners and their lives will be spun around that tiny globe that they built for themselves. One might ask “Well what do you expect? Do you want them to hang out and not move forward with their lives?” and yes the truth is that it should happen, but that doesn’t lessen the pain in any way.\nDo not ever put someone through the pain of a breakup after years of building memories. Pull the band aid early on if you know you can’t fix it. Do not I beg you for the love of god go along hoping that things will turn out all right in the end and then jump ship after years and years.\nDate: 16.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI made it to this morning somehow. Surprisingly I was able to calm my mind to focus on my work after all that happened. I’m not sure if I’m running away from things when I sit down to work now. There will always be emotions to unpack and process, regardless of how long you have been trying to heal yourself. I had defined my life’s purpose is to find peace wherever I am and if working on a trivial task without an ultertior motive of acceptance and admiration brings me peace then so be it.\nI digress, what I have learned today so far is that it’s all right to indulge your senses, and when trying to learn something new it can be daunting if you set the expectation of being an expert in every thing that you do. Very rarely you will be a fully fledged expert despite talking about it. Not everyone who says they are a statistician are fully understanding the concepts of measure theory nor are they always thinking of expectations and distribution functions. These are all arbitrary definitions that were set out by society and we get to have some lee way in how we view it. We decide how we want to present ourselves, how others view us is purely their task. There will always be that story of the couple traveling with their donkey that were told by different people that each seating arrangement that they set up was bad.\nAlso I have come to terms with the fact that as friends become closeted in their own sphere, it’s a good opportunity to still learn their strategies and methods to handle the distance from other friends. There is always something to learn from someone. They might not give you that lesson but always the case with friends is that they impart with you some knowledge and even if they stayed or left that knowledge will still be with you for long.\nDate: 17.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI do not have much to say my little one. I didn’t have anything profound yesterday. I’m still coming to terms with losing and having friends. I’m coming to terms with my future and how it will pan out. I am lost to say the least. Nothing much to say apart from that. At times like these, it’s best your old man takes care of himself by letting himself indulge in some of the things that he purposefully refrains himself from. That’s just a matter of survival perhaps. It feels as if I’m running away, but am I going to be a dictator and prevent myself from running away from things that scare me when I do not have even myself to rely on. It’s hard reparenting myself and I hope to god that you wouldn’t have to walk through the same pathway as I am.\nSometimes it’s good to get out of your house and vent your thoughts to someone you can trust. I still wonder where I got the idea that friendships needs to be nurtured. Perhaps friends that have gone through good and bad times together would stick together for long times. Regardless, it’s best to make sure that you don’t keep everything in your head and vent it out to someone you can trust. If there are none you can trust to talk about it, the best place would be to take a walk outside and talk with people that are not in the same domain as you. The main idea is to find a way to detach yourself from the constructs you have built for yourself.\nDate: 18.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nThere will be times in your life where you will have to be tough with your inner child. It is not ideal that my main method of motivation is the desire to feel useful or to comply with an identity that I have built for myself. It is effective still I must say when I get hyperfixated on something and keep on working until my body demands rest. Like the race horse that only knows the gunshot to start running at its best speed, the only way that I knew how to do better in my work is to instill the idea that I am not good enough and I need to reach this X benchmark to prove to myself that I am capable of doing things. It sucks out the enjoyment of many things that I’m doing honestly because all I’m hyperfixated on is the final appearance or the outcome of it.\nIn a way I need to stay in touch with the things that I want to improve on more. That is the final lesson that I learned so far from my end. Also I need to lower my requirement for gym work as just reaching the gym. You already won if you reached the place of work. That is the first step and that is more than enough I feel.\nIf ever you feel stuck in life my little one know that with time things will make sense. There’s more to life than the work that you do. At the end of your life what matters is whether you were at peace through it all. Working on my small inconsequential plots brings me peace because it feels like a small puzzle that I have to figure out how to build while reading the solution manual (yes your old man would read the solution manual and try to solve the puzzle first after trying all possible solutions.)\nDate: 19.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nThe effects of sleep deprivation can be intense I must say. Surprisingly I didn’t get moody as I expected myself to be. Perhaps by feeling hopeful and excited from the work that was done while sleep deprived was helpful to stabilize my mood.\nThere will be times where you feel like you are not able to do any exercise but trust me if you are capable of walking to the place of exercising then you have already won. The bigger part is showing up and not exactly what you do in it. Just showing up to the place has a big effect and that goes to your creative or logical endeavours as well.\nThe greatest friends are those that mellow out but the contact still remains as they always say. Your old man knew people and shared his life story with a lot of people. But among all of them very few are those that he would regularly call and check up on given he has the permission to do so. Maintaining friendships should not be done in a score card where the person who always checks on the other gets exhausted from it. The perfect balance comes from both parties initiating when their schedules are relatively free or they need that human interaction and you are the source for it.\nDate: 20.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nToday went well. I believe I have understood who are on my side and who will side with the highest power. People say academia is a place of free thought. There are no free thoughts in a place of hierarchy. All thoughts come with an associated volume when there’s a hierarchy involved. Some would simply bend their head and not speak while others would try yelling over the volume and end up annyoing those around them. Funnily enough the person who yells louder is the one that gets scrutinized and not the high volume that is already there. And then there are those who would simply walk away to a quieter place to talk.\nI have realized that it’s best to put my passions out in writing for those who want to hear it. Often times we overthink how perfect things should be based on the end product of someone who has worked on a ceratin project for ages. Start by making the stupidest dumbest claims possible. Simply shotpost your way to publicity as the kids would say (I don’t know what kids in your time would be saying honestly)\nDate: 21.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nLife can serve you some of the most unexpected experiences and interactions. Keep an eye open for them and always talk with people that you meet along the way that are helping you, reagrdless of their status and where they are coming from. Always pay attention to the little things that people talk about and if you can associate them with those little things so you can talk about them later on. It will come natural once you start trying it, for me it was a survival mechanism that I built to show that I paid attention to the people that were talking with me.\nThey say there’s peace in solitude, but my little one, there are days where I doubt that a lot. For solitude comes the absence of people which means all the good things of having people would also be gone. Perhaps a day will come where I enjoy solitude while filling in the gap that would be there from not having people around. It is a normal human behavior to wish for summer when winter is around and wonder why winter is far away once summer comes to its peak.\nDate: 22.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI had closure today of a friend that wanted to separate from me. I know that I am at fault and the only unansweered question was on the specifics of the fault. Your old man is not perfect as you might have already known. And it’s okay for you to make mistakes as well my little one. I have lost many friends because of my mistakes and at this rate its best that I start building happiness in solitude for I doubt I will ever find a place where I am capable of maintaining friendships for long times.\nI have always wanted to live the life of a monk, but the solitude and silence always scared me. To be alone with my thoughts is scary to me. To face the torrent of thoughts that could go anywhere and most likely end up in places where I would feel hurt. Perhaps to accept solitude I need to first sit with my thoughts and go forth.\nDate: 23.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt’s best to know when to take care of yourself and when to push yourself for the sake of those you care about. I am starting to feel ill these few days and I believe it’s getting worse today. This illness I speak of is simply a mere cold but I fear it might be progressing towards a slight fever.\nDate: 24.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI use to do my best to believe that there is peace in solitude. But the truth is that I simply have an anxiety that simply can not be rid of because of how easy it is access my smartphone. I cycle through the apps looking for a message to read or to reply to, while I see nothing but emptiness. As a starving rat trying to find some form of evidence to reassure itself that it is not in danger, I am trying my best to reassure myself that I am not alone and that people are not talking to me because they are simply busy. It is hard for someone who was used to being given the silent treatment as a punishment.\nRegardless above all what I need to make sure is that I don’t try to follow the same pattern as my childhood and try to work hard on something that would make others notice me and see me as valuable. My life goal is to find peace and that does not mean I need to be pushing myself unnecessarily in the face of feeling lonely.\nIt’s interesting how some people would give the advice of getting a life and doing something as a solution to having the compulsive behavior to check the phone when feeling lonely, when in reality such an advice could very much be a trauma response to some that reinforces the behavior.\nOne important detail that I saw being mentioned was the difference between a reaction and a response in the face of feeeling lonely. Your reaction to the situation could be either checking your phone more feverishly, or even deciding to suddenly do things that would make you feel values by others. Your response on the other hand can be first observing how you are feeling and addressing the feeling that you are feeling and acknowledging it. The difference is subtle but it also has tiny roots in the many teachings of eastern philosophies regarding ‘not doing’ / ‘not acting on emotions’.\nDate: 25.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt is interesting how difficult parenting can be when you have to parent yourself. You are not sure if you are emulating the same beaviour that your parents performed on you, or if you are actually being gentle to yourself.\nThey say mind over body when faced with difficult situations, but there are instances where your body wouldn’t lie but your mind will. Listening to your body will get you far compared to listening to your mind all the time. Giving your mind the power over your body can be dangerous if your mind is built to treat yourself in a bad way.\nUnderstanding the subtle cues and subtext of human communication is difficult. I will say no matter how old you get, you still find out instances where you missed a key component. It might entirely be my fault most likely. Someday I will get better soon.\nDate: 26.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nSomedays I’m actually just winging it. I’m on survivor mode and I’m simply winging it through these days. My letters will be short and nonsensical at this point.\nI’m on a crossroad of emotions at the moment. I’m not sure if the idealogy that I’m following is the correct one or if it is an attempt at self sabotage by my own mind. I do not know the right answer to any of this. All I know is that I shall respond and take decisions that will make sure that my inner peace is kept safe. I will find peace in solitude somehow or the other.\nDate: 27.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nIt honestly sucks when your mind is also the reason that you are denying yourself things you would have enjoyed. Right now I only see the negatives and the problems that come forth with opening myself up. My solution is to always isolate myself and just fully focus on the work that I have at hand as an escape route. I know that what I’m doing is wrong and that I’m not working for the love of the work but more because I wanted to run away from the trauma of being neglected and isolated.\nMany a times in my life, I would come across instances where I’m reminded of the Taoist saying that goes along the lines of “The tallest tree is the first tree that gets cut down”. Sometimes it’s really better to be not the best. It’s better not to be recognised and instead stay in your lane doing your work at your own pace. You don’t have to conquer the world or win everyone’s hearts. Be happy with the cards that life dealt and make decisions that bring peace to you the most.\nDate: 28.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nLife is always full of layers of learning and getting used to I would say. Sometimes you would be getting used to many things simulataneously while trying to do something you are familiar with. I wish there was more strength and more time in the day, but I also know that I have limits to what I can and cannot achieve. Somedays I would look out at fathers playing with their childrens and wonder whether we will ever meet, my dear. I have slowly started to realize that I will be staying in my bubble of solitude and simply focusing on peace.\nDate: 29.03.2025\nTo: The one after my own heart\nI have realized that my notion of finding peace in solitude was simply a self sabotaging attempt. I have opted in to the thinking pattern of all or nothing framework, where I believe that either someone is the closest most reliable friend ever or they are nothing to me. It’s the same way that I have treated my other relationships as well, where either they are the best or they are nothing at all. The treatment that you give to yourself can also be reflected on to others. So as you get more criticial and judgemental of yourself, you start developing a sense of similiar expectancy towards others who might hurt you.\nI need to put myself out there and see that friends can be accepted despite their flaws and that there are cases where some friends can be work colleagues and that some friends can simply be friends that are in between being your close friends and a stranger.\nIf ever in life you come across a stage where you find people who matter to you, cherish them and check in on them.\nThis is important and I hope you follow at least some parts of it. Collect evidence that you matter to other people. Know that you do matter in this world no matter what. It might be hard to accept it when you are stuck and frozen unable to do anything, but it’s at those moments that you have to reach out to your friend circle and ask them how much you mean to them. See if you can go on solo dates. I know it is physically excruciating and it might seem pointless, but give it a try, just because you deserve to experience that moment.\nDate: 30.03.2025\nTo: The oe after my own heart\nToday I realized that how much of a physical effort it takes to get outside of the house and to love yourself whole heartedly. It is quite easy to give in to the idea that either you are feeling the best or the shittiest. There is peace in solitude yes and there can be peace in being with a partner, with a community. You define the peace that you want to have, not the surrounding world. It is futile to think that you can find peace simply by cutting out everyone and isolating yourself. You can climb the tallest mountain or hide in the deepest trenches, or blend in with the most crowded cities but it is you who decide how you would be in peace. If a friend or a partner comes your way let them come. Do not actively seek and let it happen by itself. Move with your existing friends in a manner that is in between a complete stranger that you hate and your soul mate. Effort needs to be a property with more than two states. Perhaps it is time to get back in to meditating, but perhaps the first step of meditating is to do it without intention. To release the arrow without your right hand knowing it is the way to be. My goal is to find peace without explicitly chasing after it. To let peace and meditation come in everyday tasks with ease. Might be lot of bogus that your old man is speaking about but there might be some truth to what he has to say.",

In my case, I believe it’s best I keep a list of reasons why I wanted to write this book. They might not exactly be bullet lists. As you might have noticed, my thinking pattern is more towards the long form of writing and not exactly towards short concise and precise articulated points.\nOne reason that I can see is that there are people who might have gone through a set of experiences similar to mine or might have observed someone going through something similar. Perhaps this book will give them insight on their thought patterns. I haven’t really identified a reader audience and tailored this book towards a specific audience. But on the off chance someone stumbles on this book and finds it interesting I hope it helps them get a new perspective on life.\nAnother reason is that I believe that my way of thinking is a bit different to others. How modest of me, to think that I’m unique to others. Well in reality I am. Each person who reads this book has a completely new perspective in life. In a world of unique people, does being unique become normal? I hope not. Normalcy requires that everyone follows the same predictable pattern, but if everyone is different and unique in the way of their thinking, then I believe being unique still holds value. An interesting argument that I have read from a book on Zen Buddhism was that every person in this world are unique while also being part of oneness (I’m not sure what the exact label to put, Daoism calls it the Dao and you might call it Mother Nature). That’s just a side tangent that I wanted to put in there.\nRegardless, if my thinking pattern is unique and not the same as everyone else, then I believe there is something for others to read and understand from my perspective hopefully. Even if it is to read this and understand that “This is not the way a person should be thinking”. That is still progress. Everyone’s working hard to write books on how to do things right. No one tries to write a book on one of the thousand ways of doing things wrong.\nAlso, ever since I started writing this book and began a journey of self discovery through therapy, I have discovered certain thinking patterns of myself that are not healthy or sustainable and I had to learn how to unlearn them quite a lot. Consider this book a simple travel diary to those who are also going through similar problems as I am and want to understand methods to overcome them.\nFinally, the reason I write this book is to leave behind my thoughts for others in the case of untimely death be it self inflicted or natural or tragic. As the first quote goes, I do not want to give up without putting down everything that I have thought of and felt in this life.",
