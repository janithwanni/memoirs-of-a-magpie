    "text": "1 Welcome\nThis is my ikigai (生き甲斐) 1. My purpose in life when I searched through my soul was to leave a legacy behind to be remembered by. Out of the few things that I’m good at, writing and overthinking are one of them. In the chapters to come I will be putting onto tiny little pixels on your screen a stream of consciousness. My consciousness to be precise. This is my way of leaving behind a legacy wherein someone will stumble through these pages and find some use of it. Or if not someone might see this last attempt at finding purpose in life and see the importance of it. If all of the above fails then at least someone will look at these pages and see that what matters is not the blank half written pages that see the light of day, but the ideas that yearn to be seen and heard. I will be putting forth different aspects of my life and the things that I have learnt from them.\nBut I hear you ask, why is this in a book format? This could have been a blog. Yes, it could have been many things. A blog, an essay or just a social media post. The reason for that is simple, I wanted to write a book ever since I was little. Now when considering my time, skill and energy upto now, I might not be able to make a good contribution of a book. Therefore this is the book that I shall leave behind at my demise. Just the thoughts that made up who I am, not the long winding biographical details and storylines, but rather my mind as ever changing it is.\nIn no means are my thoughts and ideas the gospel truth or the absolutely correct pattern of thinking. It is of human nature to view the same world in different perspectives. That is what brings growth. Therefore in these pages I will be bearing my true self in it’s raw form. I will be bearing out the flaws that my thinking and how I came one step closer to thinking in a different and hopefully better way of thinking."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Almost everyone in their life has helped another person at some point or the other. Either by obligation or by kindness. What I will be talking about in this chapter is about the ways that people help each other, the morality of helping others, how people burn out from helping others and finally the expectations of receiving help.\nKindness is an obvious reason to help others. However, the real question is why are we being kind to this person. For many they feel a sense of sadness, empathy for the other person and thereby a desire to help comes into mind. There are other reasons that people help others. One would be to feel a sense of power or the other person. In this case people would feel that sense of sadness because they believe they are far ahead or in a better position in life. There is a slight tendency of some people in this category to impose their idea or help simply because they are better at it. In such cases it is best to avoid the help of such people although it might come at a price of actually being helpless. I personally prefer to preserve my autonomy than to give it away and follow someone else’s ideas blindly. That sounds a lot like I’m stubborn and whether you view it as a good or bad quality depends on the perspective you have on the quality. A stubborn detective chasing down a crime scene and not taking other’s opinions is accoladed when he turns out to be right while the stubborn man who sticks to his conservative ideas deeply is shunned. The same quality can be beneficial and harmful in certain scenarios.\nPeople tend to have a certain repulsion to help others who are way ahead of them in life and seem to be extremely resourceful. I have that tendency and I shroud it under the name of being efficient in who I am helping. The analogy being that there is no point to filling an cup that is already filled to the brim and is overflowing. One might argue that the person who already has a lot of help might not be receiving the right type of help and that I might be the person who can actually give the exact help they need. I must admit that is rare, partly because what I have to offer is in no way unique or extravagant. Therefore if I feel like this person will find a replacement help in case I am unavailable I would put less effort on to it. In a way, that is the way that I try to feel valued in life, where I feel important and responsible.\nThis feeling of being valued for your help comes from my childhood from what I have discovered through my therapy sessions. Growing up my parents always taught me to help others in need and it was accepted in the family that you are only useful in the household if you provide some help. Which is true in a way because maintaining a household is a collective effort. However, the slippery extreme of this becomes where you would not be able to exist in a place where your help is not needed, and my dear reader, we often will find ourselves in such places. In such cases, accepting that your value in life is not defined by the amount of help you do to others is crucial. I will add more on this on the chapter about the value of life (See Chapter 4). The gist of the idea is that the value of a person’s life is not measured by the help they give at a certain point in time but by the energy, personality and effect they have on other people. You might be in a completely new country unable to help anyone at all and you will spiral thinking you are not useful, believe me for I have been there. The reality is that there are things that you give to others by default unseen which includes the overall energy, compassion and empathy you bring to the table.\nAnother side effect of this extreme is that you would be unwilling to accept help unless you have shown that you can bring something to the table. This becomes increasingly frustrating to people who want to help you out when you are starting off new or if they have walked the path that you have walked in. I had to deal with many people like that and this aversion to accepting help has to come with time as they slowly learn to accept that getting help without any expectations is not wrong. My main argument I bring in such scenarios is that by not allowing others to help you, you are also depriving them of the opportunity to help you making them feel sad, frustrated and worried as they see that your current situation can be improved with what they have.I have tried to push myself away from that idea, into a state where I accept people’s help even if I can’t help them at the moment or maybe ever in the future. However, this also can be seen in a different perspective of me being selfish. The fine line between these two states are defined by the moment I refuse to help when asked for help, until then I can not proved to be selfish. However, be weary when accepting help from others, for sometimes people who want to give help might have an ulterior motive.\nRegarding those who do not want to accept help from others, there is also the case that they might already have people to help and your help might not exactly be needed. When giving help some people might not want to accept help because they have already established support networks. This is a hard pill to swallow but in most cases if you are a newcomer to an already established ecosystem it might be hard for you to find your place in this network where and who you can offer your help to. What I have learned is that I will offer my help and leave the door open for others to seek help while in the meantime I try to help myself by working on myself to be more useful, and also by accepting help from others to build trust and connections. There will always be a niche or something that you bring to the table and there will be someone who wants exactly that or something similar. Have faith in yourself and work on strategizing what you believe you can give best, is it quality or quantity or consistency or spontaneity?\nWhile helping people, there is a slight chance of us feeling burnt out from helping a lot of people. This feeling of burning out can represent itself in many ways. For me, this feeling of being burnt out came in the way of being overly irritated by minor inconviniences caused by mistakes from other people. For others burn out from helping too much can come in different ways such as developing a nihilistic perspective on life, isolating from everyone, having high expectations from people etc. Whatever the cause is, it is best to understand that part of helping people comes with a set of boundaries that you have to enforce on yourself internally and when necessary externally. For those who are not so used to saying no, the word boundaries does not go hand in hand when helping people most of the times. Let’s look at boundaries in a different way then. When people are expecting help from you, any sane person who is not a self centered tyrant would want to get help from you in a way that is sustainable to get help from you in the long run."

    "title": "3  On the unseen board games that humans play",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Humans are interesting in the way that they play different games with the people around them. Most of these games are seen in large screens and stadiums alike. But the games that go unseen a lot are the games of social interactions. Every human as they grow up builds up different standards, governing rules or presets for the social interactions that they experience. They build certain rules within them and as they grow old and meet other people who uphold similar standards these rules start solidifying gradually. Some might call these biases or some might even call these common sense.\nI have been told many times that I am someone who seems to struggle to understand these social cues. I have lost many friendships due to that. Lost is a pretty dramatic word I believe and therefore a better phrase would be broken beyond recognition (I’m sure there’s a German word for that phrase). I would often not see or understand these social cues and overstep boundaries or say things that offend or hurt people. The fault is primarily in me, one might say, and yes, that might predominantly be the case. But reliance on social cues and common sense to work your way through social interactions can be quite harmful actually.\nPicture this, you are a professional in the field of Computer science, to the point that you are the designated IT guy wherever you go. When dealing with people with less IT knowledge, you are bound to understand that the things that you hold as common sense might not be the same for the other people.\nNow let’s look at a person called Jane. Jane has lived her life learning how to talk with people by observing her parents and accepting the rules and advices that her parents gave strictly. As Jane grows up she finds like minded people that are also capable of speaking with her nonverbally the same way that she was brought up. She understands that following the inherited rules seems to work properly and she keeps on adding more rules as she grows up. Then Jane gets to meet John who has interacted with a different group of people, and John’s circle of friends are quite direct in the way they communicate, they do not leave anything for nonverbal communication and are always explicit about what they are feeling. When Jane has a conversation with John, she gets annoyed that John isn’t picking up on the nonverbal communication she’s having with John and calls him someone without social skills or common sense.\nWhile non verbal communication and explicit open communication has it’s place, I would advocate for the latter. Be explicit and precise in your speech by putting forth any discomfort or happiness that you felt and being specific about what you experienced and what you don’t want the other person to feel. Yes it’s a lot of work, and so is explaining in detail to your mother the features of her phone, but it pays off in the end.\nIf ever you feel that you aren’t getting non verbal communications, be direct about it and say upfront to a person, “Hey if you do ever feel uncomfortable or feel any distress from what I say while talking with you, please do tell me at that exact moment, you can directly say it without an issue. I’m asking this favor from you because I don’t want to cross your boundaries and make you feel even more uncomfortable.” Be upfront about these things. For an extroverted free thinker it’s really hard to do this because they are used to speaking their mind openly and explicitl."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Strangely enough, I have met quite a lot of people that seem to value the people around them than themselves. They would go above and beyond to help their inner circles stay motivated and consistent, yet rarely will they be able to do the same for themselves. There are those who do not follow the pattern and the proportions of those who do and don’t are not part of this stream of thought. My focus is on those who value the people around them more than themselves. The selfless martyrs that are willing to cross oceans regardless of whether other party is willing to jump through puddles.\nBeing such a person myself, I had to ask myself. Why did I come to this stage? What sort of behavior in my childhood attributed me to being a person that was willing to help others no matter what? Perhaps it could have been religious influence or the way that I observed my parents to be acting when others were under duress. Or it could be that I was primed to understand that only those who gave everything they had and asked for none were truly valued by everyone else. Regardless of the reason we are here now. They say knowing is half the battle and I do not believe knowing the reason why would give us much solace in most cases. But understanding what this issue means to our lives and how we can navigate into the future from where we are matters more in my opinion.\nWhile the world does need more of people who are selfless and kind, continued exposure to these behaviors may cause people to erupt and go into extremes of either being completely negelctful of everyone around them or damage themselves in a way that their help can not be well received. I have been through this question quite a lot. It might be my ADHD speaking but I would sometimes go into hyperfocus mode when it comes to the people around me to the point that it becomes unhealthy for both parties as the receiving end develops a learned helplessness while the other end fights a constant battle between what their soul is telling them vs what their hearts and minds are telling them.\nIt is human nature to perservere. Ask anyone who has attempted to end their life (it would be quite difficult to ask someone who succeeded) how much the human body desires to live. Try holding your breath to see how quickly you gasp for air, glad to be alive again. Try tieing a polythene bag over your head and slowly notice how your fingers automatically claw at the knot to find air to breathe. Watch how many people who were caught in between their self burn attempts would desparately try to douse themselves of the fire. Many people have chosen these examples to showcase that those who try to commit suicide actually are not genuinely trying to do it. The reason why I brought this up was because inside every person that overworks themselves to please or satisfy someone else is a battle between the heart and the soul. The heart feels emotions and wants to help the person in distress selflessly, while the soul is struggling to make room and adjust the stress levels for recovery and perservearance. Like a pendulum swinging back and forth the mind of the martyr swings between “I will do anything to help you through this.” and “I hate this, can’t you honestly do this by yourself?”. This toxic behavior builds up to the point of bringing in another problem which I will discuss in length below.\nAn interesting aspect of my thought pattern that I have come to realize after years of battling depression, is that I would put value to my life based on how much I’m capable of helping those around me. The process is pretty straightforward. First I try to selflessly help many people around me by taking up too many tasks and opportunities, which brings me to a state of being unable to work well in across all of these tasks. Any person with an ounce of sense would be screaming out that you can’t have all of the tasks and still be good at all of them. That is something I have to learn slowly and as I put down my thoughts. Hopefully putting down my thought process on a book for the world to see will either help me change the way that I think or the world will give me signs that I need to change the way that I’m thinking. Anyways, once I have filled my plate, I will take this challenge head on with all of the intensity that I can muster as there is always something novel to explore. However, as I’m giving inadaquate amounts of efforts in each section my progress dims down significantly. It comes to the point where I would be feeling like I’m actually putting no value into these projects. The usual existential crisis of “What am I even doing with these things?” comes into play at full swing at this moment. As I step down into this magical land slowly the things that I have done so far start to crumble infront of me. Whatever work I have created or any good I have done in this world is reduced to pure coincidence and just luck. I might have helped someone through their toughest times but at that moment it would simply be disregarded as “just telling obvious things that anyone would have said”, “I just happened to be there and anyone else could have done the same thing”. It’s fascinating how this happens though. It could be rooted in my childhood where I observed the pattern that once I fail to do one task, I was considered a failure regardless of the other tasks that I have done. As I have said earlier, this is not an inspection into why but rather a what can be done. Now once my mind has brought all of my work and everything I have done to zero value by categorizing the work as something that anyone could have done, it will come to a fun conclusion.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I put value on my life based on how much I’m capable of helping people. Now when the value of those helping moments are dimnished I have to come to the conclusion that my life itself has no value. What use is a life that is not useful to others. But that is only a perspective that I hold on to my life and only to it. I will not be thinking the same way of the people that I’m with. In fact I would thank them many times just for being there and that what they have done is quite unique and irreplacable.\nWhat exactly gives value to a life? Is it truly the work that they have done for the people around them, or is it based on the energy that they bring to the people around them? These are questions that would need to be discussed in length in the upcoming pages, but for now let’s explore the different ways that people value their lives. When given the question, what makes your life valuable? It raises a secondary underlying question? Why should a life be valued? The notion of a hierarchy is what brings forth a majority of inequalities and suffering. Instead of asking what makes your life valuable the real question would be to ask, what is your reason for living? If you are living simply because of someone else that is when you start giving a value to your life based on the usefulness that you have towrds others. But instead if you are living for your own self, then the value of your life only depends on the things that your heart yearns to do. And the heart can yearn for a lot of things. At our lowest moment, our heart yearns to feel connected. From what I have experienced, there is always an opportunity for a person to feel connected. Feeling connected does not necessarily mean that you need to be talking with people, although in my case that is how I connect with people. If that is the way you connect with people then you might want to stay tuned because even I’m at a loss when it comes to that stage. My initial hypothesis was that talking with people on the internet or even in a bar might be helpful. But it requires energy to get out of your low stage and walk or travel to the nearest place where people gather. That is why my next hypothesis was that it might be a good idea to simply go and join any random twitch stream and comment along with other people. You might feel a certain kindredship in the way that everyone is rooting for the same person to play the game in a certain way.\nThe games that people play are certainly interesting. You can meet a bunch of people that are playing a game of pool and you can simply be in the sidelines cheering along with the rest of the crowd and as they see your enthusiasm and your cheers, they slowly open up to you. It’s an interesting phenomenon that I have experienced in countries that are outside of the south asian region. It depends on the openness of the group that is playing to accept people from the outside. Generally if people are going in a tight knit group with only the idea of enjoying the moment with that group alone."

    "title": "5  On chasing dreams",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since I was little, I do not remember exactly when, I would be interested in a weird variety of topics and have the wildest dreams children can have. That is one of the sweet innocenct qualities that children possess, the naive optimism and whole hearted belief that things are possible if you try doing it. We dress up and act as our parents when we play tea party or play houses, even though we have zero knowledge on the actual weight of being a parent or a breadwinner. We simply know the individual traits and actions to mimic of certain characters. Similarly when we were little we would have high hopes on we would want to become. There was so much potential within us as we would loudly proclaim in a room full of strangers or acquaintances that we would one day be teachers, doctors, pilots, astronauts or engineers. We had no clue on the exact implications, the process, the requirements but we loved dreaming about them. We would do and act as if we were that person to embody that dream. And as anyone who is reading this already knows, those dreams soon fade away and are replaced with things and we never expected yet we enjoy or are neutral towards the things that we are currently doing.\nIn my early school days, I would be interested in a variety of hobbies. To put it short I would be doing robotics and electronics for a few months and then moving on to cardistry. It led to my parents believing that I would not commit to anything when I start something new, and I can’t blame them. After seeing a person not being able to commit many times, your internal bias starts growing that this person would always shift from one hobby to another. But I have stuck with a few hobbies that I found interesting, and all the hobbies that I left out gave me stories and experiences that I can use to relate to people from different areas.\nThis chapter is for those who are lost on feeling like they have a lack of purpose or they have too many opportunities and can’t pick any. While it is possible such a person might have an Attention Deficiency Disorder where they have a hard time regulating attention, I would forego that usual recommendation to go seek medical help and talk about how to make the best and accept the situation we are in. Why would I avoid the usual recommendation? For one, if you can make the best out of the hand you have been dealt and you are happy and content with the life that you currently have and it is built in a way that is sustainable for you in the long run, is there a reason to seek medication to be a fraction of a finer version of yourself? And second I’m not a medical professional to diagnose your condition to simply put the fear of a mental condition in your head. However, if by following other’s advices you still seem to struggle and your current condition is negatively affecting your life constantly, I would suggest that you go and seek medical attention. The bottom line is that what I have to give in this chapter are my thoughts and exercises that I use to handle my situation and it is of noway an fool proof guide or a litmus test for mental conditions.\nNow after that train wreck of a derailment, let’s get on with the rest of the conversation. What were we talking about? Chasing dreams and choosing opportunities. Well in life what I have found out to be the main lesson in my search was that, anything you learn will be of use someday, even if it shapes the way that you percieve or act upon a task. An student learning to be an accountant decides to switch careers and becomes a chef. Does that mean all of his knowledge in balancing ledgers are gone to waste? Probably, but the foundational skills of seeing the finer details, making comparisons and processing information in a faster way might be helpful when they are dealing with new recipes, food or even if they start their own restaurant. It could be that the student didn’t actually gain any skills from the accounting class, but still it might just provide a good icebreaker over a fellow workmate, or even a prospective partner in the future. In my native tongue there is a saying which translated means, “The one thing that thieves or your enemies can’t steal from you are the knowledge and skills you have gained”. While it is quite a useful saying for a parent who wants to encourage their children to study harder, it does also have a bit of wisdom in it. For those who feel like they have been set back in time because they wasted so much time learning something useless, just know that those skills will come in handy someday, everyone is on their own timelines and we decide how we want to play the hands we have been dealt. People who might be ahead of you in the new career that you are stepping in to might have spent ages honing their skills in that area but you also have something that you bring to the table. It might be a set of small napkins but those napkins might be the reason that someone gets to have a clean meal.\nIf the case is that whatever you learn will be useful to you in the end, what should someone do when feeling lost of having no purpose or having too many opportunities to pick from? Pick one and strive hard at it and see if it fits you. Yes I hear your woes of not having enough time. Time is running out, yes, and employers won’t hire people who are near retirement age, yes, and therefore you need to take the best decision that you can make right now to get to the top as fast as possible. The question then becomes, is it the case that when you do find the thing that you love, it would be difficult to make a living out of it because people would not be willing to pay for it? That might be true in certain professions, but I believe wholeheeartedly with the innocent child in me that there will always be a way to make a standing for yourself and earn enough to live a content life. Mind you it might not be a luxurious life, but it might be enough for you to survive. Life isn’t easy when you bring money into the picture. Money brings a lot of imbalances and injustices to this world. It might not be entirely the fault of money but it does have a say in how your life is structured.\nComing back to our original question and answer, there is a certain idea that Cal Newport had brought up in his book, “So good they can’t ignore you”. His idea was that in summary, you should not chase your passions and instead should work hard on one thing until you become passionate about it. This brings us back to the original topic of how children proclaim their passion. They have no clue of what is needed to be a pilot, they just learned what the letter G looks like much less feel multiples of them on their body as they fly an aircraft. Our passions are determined when we are young by the idea of being a certain person, not the by the idea of having to work hard to be that person. A child sees a violinist on stage and falls in love with the idea of being able to create such wonderful music. His passion is to be a violinist and then he decides to pick up the violin and learn it. Lo and behold the sound of screaming cats fill the room in the first attempt. The setback doesn’t bother him as he keeps on practicing determined to be the person he wants to be. But everyday his practices drive him further away from that dream as he realizes how much he has to learn. Evidently he gives up on it. On the other hand he picks up the flute just because he could whistle a bit and gives it a go. He has no vision or any high standard of who he wants to be. He is simply focused on having fun blowing wind into the flute. Little by little, it gets to him that he is capable of something as he focuses primarly on just playing the flute. Soon he’s playing in the same stage as the violinist that he once aspired to be but in the wind section.\nSo what was the lesson here? Pick one task, focus on the present moment and focus on the foundational skills and find enjoyment in it, use your dreams as a rudder but never as a whip on yourself. Eventually things will fall into place. Time is running out for everyone, money is hard to come by, but if we were to die tomorrow tragically, wouldn’t we rather die living a content life than a rich one?"

In my case, I believe it’s best I keep a list of reasons why I wanted to write this book. They might not exactly be bullet lists. As you might have noticed, my thinking pattern is more towards the long form of writing and not exactly towards short concise and precise articulated points.\nOne reason that I can see is that there are people who might have gone through a set of experiences similar to mine or might have observed someone going through something similar. Perhaps this book will give them insight on their thought patterns. I haven’t really identified a reader audience and tailored this book towards a specific audience. But on the off chance someone stumbles on this book and finds it interesting I hope it helps them get a new perspective on life.\nAnother reason is that I believe that my way of thinking is a bit different to others. How modest of me, to think that I’m unique to others. Well in reality I am. Each person who reads this book has a completely new perspective in life. In a world of unique people, does being unique become normal? I hope not. Normalcy requires that everyone follows the same predictable pattern, but if everyone is different and unique in the way of their thinking, then I believe being unique still holds value. An interesting argument that I have read from a book on Zen Buddhism was that every person in this world are unique while also being part of oneness (I’m not sure what the exact label to put, Daoism calls it the Dao and you might call it Mother Nature). That’s just a side tangent that I wanted to put in there.\nRegardless, if my thinking pattern is unique and not the same as everyone else, then I believe there is something for others to read and understand from my perspective hopefully. Even if it is to read this and understand that “This is not the way a person should be thinking”. That is still progress. Everyone’s working hard to write books on how to do things right. No one tries to write a book on one of the thousand ways of doing things wrong.\nAlso, ever since I started writing this book and began a journey of self discovery through therapy, I have discovered certain thinking patterns of myself that are not healthy or sustainable and I had to learn how to unlearn them quite a lot. Consider this book a simple travel diary to those who are also going through similar problems as I am and want to understand methods to overcome them.\nFinally, the reason I write this book is to leave behind my thoughts for others in the case of untimely death be it self inflicted or natural or tragic. As the first quote goes, I do not want to give up without putting down everything that I have thought of and felt in this life."
